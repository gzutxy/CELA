"The human rights is one of the most popular topic in morden world.In my opinion, the most important human rights are freedom and equal rights.
Everyone in the world is equal.They should get the same treatments and get the same legual protection.And another important right is freedom.Everyone in the world is independent.They do not belong to anyone or anything.
With the increassing of population.There are many problems come up.
Food is the first.It needs to increase the planting area. land resources will be threatened.Housing is second, the housing area increased, a large number of developers will land. In addition, investment in all areas of the country will increase, such as the establishment of schools, hospitals.but also for some poor areas to donate money, people's employment will become even more difficult. More people, garbage will increase, it is self-evident that environmental pollution will increase, coupled with people breathe out of carbon dioxide increased, the global temperature rise. In addition, the construction of factories increased, emissions of waste water, waste water and so on have also increased, so that all aspects together, the environmental problems are very serious. There will be incalculable impacts and losses on the country's development and the world.

"My name is mike. I have a sister who is facing the most important test in she's life. Of course, we walk in our life together and help each other every time when one needs help.When I see this test about that discuss the idea considering basic human rights and the danger of population explosion. I had a my unique idea that I think that our contry a government shouldn't be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. I had a good dream that I get my graduation certificate last night. When I graduated from the USTB UNIVERSITY I am a genuine man. I am a prestigious man at my hometown. But I have no work and my family hope I have a secure work. In consequence of that,
I am going to find my woke which I think it is prospecting. But after I have tried some way. I failed because my characteristics identify always appealing me to be genuine and I show some short in public. I want to make my assignment. I had a try my best but nothing in return.

I find my first work that cleans street in town. When that time I come back to my bed with a smile. After this dream. I change my thought that a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Because if our country can do it perfically, all of us will get a work but not always hungry because of too many people in our pleace.",4.5,5,4,3.5,3,3
"With the release of the law that permit a family to have two children, opinion concerning this hot topic varies from person to person. Plenty of people hold the view that agovernment should not be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.They think the law is a disrespect of the basic human rights, but other people disagree them.
In my view, I hold the belief that a government are allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.There are my reasons.
above all, the resource in the world is limited. If we don not control the population, our posterity may get into trouble of the resource scaricity easily.Then, the operating post in our country is also limited.More person we have, more stress we will undertake.

"First, I have to admit that the problem between basic human rights and the danger of population explosion is a complex question. Though I can't give the right answer, I want to express my own view about the issue as a student now.
If we want to know the problem in depth, we could pay our attention to Europe. The public of Europe have to face the situation now, because of the refugees. And we know their answers, they will not be equal human rights anymore if the population explosion has happened, and it is also my answer too.
No one could solve the problem now, even if the democratic and rich countries like Europe's countries. Because there is not enough living room for everyone on earth, such as food water and the opportunity to work. And it is an unavoidable problem when the population explosion appears.
Of course, turn back and look at our country, China. We have carried out the family planning a few years ago, it is the way to control the population to protect our basic human rights. So far, we know it is effective, and I'm very thankful that I have my own basic human rights now.

"Population explosion is one of the most serious problems in the world. Therefore a rule was promulgated to limit the number of children a family can have.
In my opinion,it obeys basic human rights,some people really like children and they have financial to bring them up. They should have as many children as they like.
Besides,only one child in a family causes some problems.The children always feel lonely,meanwhile parents often give them too much love,which lead them have some bad habits,just like selfish.
Some people think population explosion bring some problems.It may increase the earth burden,we need more food to feed people,we need more water,more resources.However,I believe people have enough able to solve those problems.
Considering the future of our children,limit the number of children is unwise.

"Too many people will bring great burden to society, so I think a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.
In the first place, too many children will put pressure on the family's ability to support, and each child will not be able to enjoy the resources or educational resources of sufficient love.Second, too many people will make everyone's living resources inadequate. Oil, water, medical resources, and even living conditions can be very stressful.In addition, too many people will make employment difficult. If too many people can not find jobs, then social stability will not be guaranteed and social crime rates will rise.
In summary, I think a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.

"With the increasing of the pWith the increasing of the population, we are facing more and more problems during our life. So it is nessary to limit the population.

"With time flies, there are more and more people on the globe. So, how to control the increase of popularity becomes a urge and troublesome question.
Well, an another question is raised--why should we control the number of people ? Firstly, there is limited resource on the earth, so our environment don't admit an endless increase. Secondly, if there are too many people, everyone will face bigger challenges whether in housing, working, eating or in medical treatment. Then, this may also cause wars between different countries for contesting resource. 
Therefore more and more countries' governments take some politics on this question. Just take our country China as an example, in 1971, China carried out a policy--family planning which encourage one couple to bring up one child and this policy was written in constitution in 1980. From the view of today, this is a good policy, it decreases the press of economy of families and helpful to national's economical level. Meanwhile, it makes our society appear more talents who receive higher education. It also speeds the accumulation of fund in our country. 
But there are some disadvantages, such as the high percent of the old, teenagers will more stress on supporting their older parents, and if an old couple's child happen to die in an accident. The parents' life will become a huge trouble.
As a matter of fact, in 2011, our government did some adjustments on this policy. One couple can have two children. This adjustment is helpfully make up for the loophole of the regional one. It is enough proper. I'm really in favor of it. Two child can help each other and face somethings and stress together.

"Two thousand years ago, in the age of augustus, there were about 200 million people in the world, up to 300 million. It is important that humans have used the entire 19th century to increase the global population to 1.6 billion in 1900. But after that, The world population almost exploded.
The population explosion inevitably leads to urbanization and deteriorating living conditions. Lack of clean water, Mass panic and air and water pollution and so on. These are the problems of population explosion.
We will have to face this pressure, partly regional and partly transnational, immigration pressures. Rich Europe and North America will be the main targets of continental immigration. As a whole, European governments and parliaments and European societies have faced this extraordinarily difficult problem today: How many immigrants do they believe in? What type of immigration are they willing to accept in terms of nationality, language, religion and skills? What can be done to stop unwelcome immigrants?
In summary, something can be sure: The wave of migration will increase dramatically in the near future, In Africa and parts of Asia, population pressures will further lead to limited regional conflicts, civil wars and wars.

"Nowadays, it's common to see that a family contains 3 members, including a father ,a mother and a child. According to the policy of one child, most Chinese families only have one and if you broke the limitation, you will meet the punishment of money.
But is it really correct for government to control the number of a family? As we all know, one person is alone, which means you must solve all the problems without others' help and when your parents are old, all the responsibilities need to be taken by yourself, meanwhile you have your own family accompanying with new challenges. 
However, China is a country with a large number of population, which results to some serious troubles. One of the troubles is the imbalance of enormous population and short land resource. The resources are limited, therefore, it's necessary for government to introduce policy of population.
In my opinion, I expect that our government could exchange the policy based on our true life. I know that our country is gradually open the two children policy, it's really good.

"To tell you the truth, I didn't understand or think about the basic human rights until I saw the composition topic. So I searched for relevant information about basic human rights. And I found that it contains twelve basic rights. When it comes to the population explosion, it's a difficult problem all over the world right now. The resources of the earth are limited, and the population exceeds the carrying capacity of the land, which will cause many problems. Among them, the social security rights in the basic human rights will suffer a lot of negative impact. In my opinion, the continuous growth of the population is the inevitable course of human development. However, the population can not be over increased. We should improve the current basic human rights assurance system. The control of the population seems to be a limitation of human rights, but it is really for better protection of human rights.",4,4,3,4.5,4,3
"With the universal two-child policy allowed, many babies were born for the reason that the parents want to get another baby. But what makes the government allows this policy?
As you know, the single-child policy starts in 80s in the last century to slow the population growth rate. Then it leads to the ageing of the population, which means the rate of the elders becomes higher. Thus, the two-child policy has to be taken to increase the number of the young man.
However, every coin has two sides. The increasing rate of the young man means that there would be more competition for the youth to live in.
In my opinion, the policy will make our country more active, and more competive.

"I think the government should limit the number of children each family can has, regardless of the population or size of the country.
As we all know, the number of people that the earth can bear is limited. If it exceeds this limit, the ecology of the earth will suffer devastating destruction and can not even be restored.At the same time, limiting the number of population can improve the quality of each individual and optimize the population structure.If the population of a small country wants to boost its population, it may consider building a partnership with a large population to attract migrants.
In short, it is necessary for the government to limit the number of children in each family.

"As time goes on, world population has been constantly increasing. This leads to many serious problem, such as population boom, resource shortage and so on. So some government attend to limit the number of children in a family to solve these problems. But some people disagree with them. They think it violates basic human rights and it should be forbidden. For my perspective, I think they all have their own standpoint. We should keep balance between them.
For example, Chinese government practice a new policy to limit the number of children in a family. At first, the new policy works well. However, as time goes on, there are many problems exposed, such as aging of population and hard to support parents. Therefore, Chinese government decides cancel the policy .Finally I suggest every country should, according to their own national conditions, practice proper policies and at the same time not harm the interests of the people.

"When it comes to basic human rights, I think of the right of equality and freedom. As we all know, people of different races are treated in different ways in a way in the world. Though it's a common-sense that everyone own equal rights , the white race feel superior to the yellow and black and discriminate them in social life. As far as I see, everybody wants to have equal rights in all fields of life. Besides, we all need to meet all kinds of choices and no one would like to be forced to make a choice, which doesn't follow their heart, for example, the salesman forced you to buy goods that you don't like at all. Thus, it's important to have freedom.
As for population explosion, I think in will increase the burden of the earth. With the growth of population, there will be less soil and more hungry people, fewer trees and more pollution. The street will be more crowded and the air is difficult to be fresh because of cars and other machines. Additionally, more animals could die out in that they lack of habitats and food. In a world, population explosion will bring many problems to us.

"Those years population explosion is a big problem to whole world. and in my opinion, the population increase is bad to earth. 
During population increasing, the world need more and more resources .such as water, pure air and gas. but our earth has limited resources, people need more ,so our earth will out of resources one day. 
But in human rights, every person is a life. We have our right, we are one of son to earth. With population increases, maybe will has war. 
in the end, with population explosion, we need to find new plant ,in this way, we can solve the question.

"To discuss this question, firstly, we should make clear about why the question was published by our government. From my perspective, I hold a view that our government publish this rule is aiming at limit the number of human, because if there are more and more people, there will be a day that the resources can't afford to pay the human's need. So from this respect, I think our government has done a right thing , but everything has its two sides, for most family, they not only want a children, but also want two or more children, because just one baby may not fit for every parent's expectation, especially in china and some traditional countries. So, to put our view into a long sight, I think what government has done is definitely right, but to consider in some human feelings, I think this is not good enough. So, what the problem is right or false is depending on how you think and what situations you are in.",4,4.5,3,3.5,4,2.5
"It's well-known that the population questions have always been a major issue in the world. Some people hold the view that we ought to insist on the basic national policy of family planning and the government must limit the number of children a family can have. However, it occurs to others that a family are able to have the freedom to decide the number of children.
In my opinion, the number of children should be limited by the government. First of all, as we all know, the number of population is getting lager and lager nowadays. Therefore, the government must take actions to prevent the population from growing too fast so that to effectively solve the population questions. In addition, population expansion will overload the planet which do harm to people's lives. Last but not least, it may bring both serious food problems and land problems or even lead to war.
In a word, the government should limit the number of children a family can have.

"Population is a major thing for constitute a country. Government have do something for the sake of country. Such as use policy to improve or reduce population. 
In Russia, government have to encourage people give birth to their children because of few population. If a Russian couple have their second or third child, government will help them bring up their child in money. 
But sometimes, too many persons could make country burthen. China has adopted one-child policy for a few decades. One of the most important reason is population explosion after China be set up. After governmental effort, now the policy is abolished. 
In this world, many developing counties like China, have a serious matter about population explosion. And some other country be faced with lack-child's problem after financial crisis. Governments have duty to improve population, but it just in encourage. Any government can't limit a couple have more children in morality. However, some governments have power to accomplish their policy. A country need to get command of population, it means too many populations become the country's encumbrance. 
A government should do something it mast to do, people also have their basic rights. If our country in danger, we need do anything we can do. If not, we should protect our right.

"I think family planning is the most effective way to solve the population problem. 
China has the largest population in the world, more than 1.3 billion, which is 20% of the world population. With the rapid increase of population, There are many problems such as employment stress .educational stress. and the medical problems ,which are becoming more and more serious. So, it is a very important and urgent to control the China population, and the Family Planning Policy is the best way.
The Family Planning Policy can lighten the social and national burden and can make each person share more resources. Although some of people have been complaining the Family Planning Policy, the advantages of are more than the disadvantages of Family Planning Policy. 
So, I think Family Planning Policy suitable for China's national conditions.

"In my opinion, the government should limit the number of children a family can have. 
Although I want a young sister or a young brother who can play with me and company me, our country do have too much people so that wherever we go we can see a lot of people. Apart from this, too much people also make many proplems which we can not imagine. For exmple, for there are lots of people, we may not have enough place to for live and we are short short for water and food. Not only that, too much people can make more social issues.

"As we can know, the number of chinese population is the largest in the world. Therefore, our goverment has limitted the number of chirldren a family can have. But should it be allowed?
As far as I am concerned, I hold the view that it is a important decision. First and the most important, our essentail resouces such as food.water and energy are limitted, but the number of population is larger and larger.Hance, if we don't take action, our son and grandson will be faced with the problem that lack the vital resources.
What's more? Now, many problems are due to the enormous population.For example, the communal facilities like school and hospital are under heavy burden.What's worse?There are still so many pepole who can't go to school and hospital owing to the poverty caused by the huge population.
What if the number of population get more and more huge?I am not sure. However, one thing is certain.They won't live a better life than us!

"I think goverment should not be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Here are many reasons.
First,Although there are so many people in china,most people are the middle-aged and old. So that a young people should care for several old people. Therefor two children will ease the burden.
Second,nowadays people's ideas have changed. Many people don't think that having many children is a good thing. So that they won't have more than two children.
Now china face a serious social aging problem,increasing the number of births can effectively alleviate the problem. I think our government don't need do that.

"As is known to us, human beings play an important important role on earth. So the basic human rights is necessary and important to the people who live in different countries. Here are my opinions.
There is a grim truth that the population is explosing too fast. It makes resource shortage. So we need a law to protect fairness so that everyone wants equal rights. At the same time, the population explosion also take other questions, such as the environmental pollution and ecological imbalance. What's more, too many people increase the difficulty to ensure every one's basic human right.

"I agree with the idea that the government be allowed to limit the number of children in a family. My evidences are as follows.
With the development of the society, the living condition is getting better and better, which makes it possible for the longevity of human. But problems also come.
First, the population explosion can bring lots of serious problems, such as hunger short of food, garbage disposal and so on. Even the terrorism may take place all over the world.
Though the number of children is decided by mom and dad, it should also be restrict by the government. We have the rights and freedom to choose the way we live. But we should also take the earth's condition into consideration. Earth is like our mother, we should love her and respect her.
All in all, I think the government should restrict the number of children a family can have. Only in this way, can we live a happy life.

"In my opinion, I hold the view that the government should make some proper policies about limiting the number of children a family can have. Here are my reasons
On one hand, our country has the largest population in the world. Overpopulation can bring many social problems. Because the resources that humans depend on are 
imited. For example, there are not enough food to eat provided that the population is too large. In this way, it's necessary for the government to take measures to limit population growth. On the other hand, considering the parents' rights and the problem of supporting old people, the government is supposed to leave room for parents to choose when making policies.
In a word, the government should consider the parents' feelings first and then make proper policies to limit population growth.

"As we all know, basic human rights is important for everyone.And there are too many people in earth to earth can't bear the burden. I would like to express my idea about the two points mentioned above.
Take China for example. In fact, living in China is extremely free. In China, you can say everyting if the speech doesn't damage country and people. Second. Besides, the most respect women country is China, women's social position is as high as men whatever in family or in school or in company. On the other hand, China's Public Security is Stabler than western. 
The population increased quikly in recent century, which means there is less area of per capita and more need of food and water. on the orther hand, population increass means more people need energy. So people will rob animal of limited resouces, which cause the reduce of type of animal.

"As everyone knows, with the society development, the population is more and more, which brings about many phenomenon. Above all, the rapid growth of the population has brought problems such as employment, housing, education, medical care and so on. In addition, the huge population base, rapid population growth, natural environment and natural resources of our country not only has a huge impact and heavy pressure, triggered a series of economic and social problems. what is the more important thing is that the improvement of the living standards of our people has been seriously affected, which directly affects the accumulation of funds of economic construction, which restricts the development of economy and the improvement of education and scientific level. 
So, in my viewpoint, limiting population growth is more significant.

"As we all know, the population of the earth is more than 7 billion today. And it's growing at a very fast rate. The danger of population explosion can not be ignored. Scientists point out that the earth can only feed 10 billion people. 
The first problem of population explosion is the shortage of food. The resources of our planet are finite. Once the resources of the earth are exhausted, the human race will become extinct. And remember, one day the Earth's resources will be depleted, and the space and space exploration is the future. But, along with the population total amount on the earth, with unbearable heavy burden of resources environment on the earth increasing rapidly, the situation allows of no the optimism.

"I thinke a government should limit the number of children a family can have according to its economy.
A large population will be a power to help the development of the country which have a strong economy otherwise it will be the burden of the development of the economy.
The population can provide work force.active for the social.But it bases on a strong economy.When a country own a large population,the country should spend money for supporting many people.It is a large burden for a country which is poor.
Generous speaking,if a country have a strong economy,it should encourage families to have many children.
If a country don't have a strong economy,it should encourage families to have less children.

"In my opinion, a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. As everyone knows, the population of our earth has already over 7 billion, and it's close to the upper limit of the world's population. The huge number of the world's population brings a variety of problems, such as the shortage of resource, the worsening environment pollution, etc. Limiting the number of children a family can have is the best way to limit the world's population effectively and can also prevent the danger of population explosion. What's more, the limitation of the number of children a family can have will also calls up more people to pay more attention to the problem of giving a better birth, so that the quality of the people will be promoted.

"With the quickly increasing of economy and great improvement of civil living condition, more and more conflits concerning whether a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have flood. 
When it comes to the issue, the rights of individuals occur to us. In some cases, the limitation infringes rights of human beings. Commonly appreciated, the younger is the source of family happiness. 
Nevertheless, from the family planning to the policy which allows, the goverment has done a lot, bending itself to controling population of our country. The menance of populartion explosion bringing disasters to the world requires reducing the population size of babies. Additionally, due to the aging population resulting in labor shortage, every family are allowed to have two children, restricting the aging population more and more serious. 
Furthermore, without the proper regulation of population, the world would be in a mess.

Although one children in the home sometimes will feel lonely,maybe they can not find anyone to accompany them. And they do not want to do anything at all.

There are many countries practiced family planning such years ago, but look from the sight of human rights ,should we control population is a series question, in my opinion , I think it is necessary ,though human have the right to birth ,but now ,the difference between animal and human is that human should be restrained by social rules, and in order to give us a better life ,we should control population.

Finally, the controlling of the birth can lead to the ""Elder society"", which means much more old people should be taken care of. That can give too much pressure to the teenagers. It can also make the country have less people to work and create. So, in one word, the goverment should not limit the number of the children a family can have.",5,5,4,5.5,5.5,3.5
"I think if the population would increase more. The human rights would meet more serious problems. 
Firstly, people would have the less resources than now, the food, water, soil and the other resources would become a more serious problem of the social. The government must put more effective and fund in the protect of environment. The social which lacks harmonious would lead violence and crime.
Then, the education quality would be lower , too. The parents would worry about their children's studying, would worry about whether their children be paid enough attention. The low-educated generations could only destroy the values they inherit from their parents.

"It could be a large question to think about what are the rights and duty, and what's the connection between these two things. But now it could be a chance for me to express my opinions just account for the question that should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. 
As it's known to us. All human have the rights to decide what's the life we can live and we also have the rights to get the freedom which belongs to us forever. According to that, we are given the rights to decide how many children we could have. And we have the freedom to give all of our children a chance to live and a chance to enjoy the happiness to be in the world. But the government forbid that. And why?
I think it need to be thought in another way. THe danger of population explosion, what are the problems it could bring? Firstly, all of our human just have an only commen home, that's the Earth, and the ability and the resource it has to support the living of human are limitationaly. what's more unlimit birth could also make a family to afford more. 
At last but not least. I support the government to limit the number of a family can have.

"In my opinion, the government shouldn't be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. So why I say this under the situation of 1.3 billion people in China? I can prove it right now.
First, China used to limit the children numbers, when the people was controlled by the idea of bring up more children means more happiness. However, nowadays, we never think that is true and the population of China even the whole world is almost full. Because the more people the more competition, we Chinese don't want to born more children any more.
Second, born is one of the human rights, I think the government ought to respect it. 
Above all, I don't think government limit the number of children is right or even necessary. Actually, China have already realized the disadvantage of the limited of children. Such as, we don't have enough young people to do the heavy works or we haven't got the money to release the retire people and so on.
All in all, the government shouldn't be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.

"Since the China founded, human rights has become an important item. People focus more on their own right. At the same time, the goverment also takes a lot of measures to satisfy people's recommments. There are many laws being changed to better protect people's profit. Human rights become a thing which is not hurt.
Another problem is population explosion. Too much population causes a lot of problems, such as less water and food. besides, pollution has also become a world-class problem. Due to too much 
population, these problems will cause a big disaster when our national population has over a limitation. And this disaster will need us use more time to deal with it.
So, we and our goverment should take more measures to face these problems and protect our better life.

"Owning more kids or just one? Facing this question, I guess most families will choose the former. Most people support that government shouldn't be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Last year, our country published a new policy about kids that every family can own two kids. There is no doubt that it was good news for most families. However, as far as I am concerned, it is bad news for the earth. Our country, China, owns the largest publication in the world, although this policy is good for our country, since we are facing a big problem of the old, and we need more young men, it also brings more stress to our country and earth. Larger publication means more resources needs, including space needs, food needs, educations needs and so on. Maybe twenty years later, young men who are facing so many problems will complain this policy. I think our government should be allowed to limit the publication, and keep limiting. To every family, maybe it is not good, but to the country's future and earth's future, it is beneficial. Less people means less resources will be used, and less pollution will be produced. In a word, publication limit is necessary, it should be allowed. I think we need to look further, and consider further.",6.5,4.5,5,5.5,6,4
"With the development of society l, population grows faster and faster . As a result, our government limits the number of children that a family can have. 
In my opinion, government should limit the number of people. Above all, more populations must create many troubles. For example, so many people will consume more resources. It is important for everyone who is on the earth. In addition, it also make how to find a job difficult. In the end, more and more families will be poor. What's more, there is no enough room for people if population adds so quickly. After all, only have enough room can family have more children. Last but not least, population is an essential part of a country. It affects a country very much. All in all, government should limit the number of children in a family.

People have different views about the problem. Some people think that the government should involve the population problem, because every one in the world own the basic human rights, so,they believe that no one have rights to kill life, on the contrary, evey life should be respected. However, other people insist that the government should limit the number of children a family can have. They hold the opinion that overpopulation will cause many problems such as human's living and natural disaster. As for me, I agree with the latter because I consider that human will benifit more from the limitation of population as well.",5,4,4.5,5,3.5,3
"In the modern international society,the basic rights are pretty essential for every person. There are some examples of the basic human rights. Such as the rights of owning self safety,equal treatments in social activities, self-determination of their property, opportunity for getting equal education and rights for participating in political activities. And for a collectivity,they derserve to get right for peace environment and the right for seeking for their labour rewards.
And for the danger of population explosion, there are many factors to limit the population. Because of the lack of resources, the earth can't support more people to live. If the amount of the population is increasing, the existing people will also become dangerous in leading a hard life. Therefore, it's horrible when people facing the population explosion.
",5,5.5,3.5,5,3.5,3
"First the rapid growth of the world population poses a great challenge to sustainable development. The population of the world has jumped from 2 billion 500 million in 1950 and 4 billion 400 million in 1980 to about 6000000000 in 2000. According to information provided by the World Summit on sustainable development, the United Nations estimates that the global population will increase to 8 billion in 2025 and 9 billion 300 million in 2050, and the global population is expected to be stable at around 105 or 11 billion. Almost all of the population growth in the future will come from developing countries, and the world will have to feed another 5 billion people for the future.
Second with the growth of population and the improvement of people's living standards, land, water, energy and other natural resources will become more tense, especially in developing countries, which may lead to an unprecedented crisis. According to the latest report of the United Nations, the Asian population growth rate decreased, but the population density is still higher than that of other continents, in East and South Asia, only 1/6 hectares of arable land per capita, with the population growth, the pressure on the land and the agricultural irrigation water shortage, forcing these areas need to increase food imports to reduce hunger and improve the nutrition structure.

"With the increasing of population, there are more than 7 billion people on the earth. The earth is crowded, and this result in some difficult problem. 
First, some resource like water.energy and soil can not satisfy everyone, so, they have to start a war to get more resource. Second, too many people maybe destroy the environment of earth. Our nature can tolerate some people but 7billion. Some problems have come out, our ice bergs melt with a very fast speed, and with more and more trees been cut down, many places change into desert, so if the problem of population can not be solved, our nature will break down one day. Finally, because of the number of people, some basic human rights can not be guaranteed, in the Africa, some children die for they can not get even a little food, and what they drink is polluted water, and in some countries which is in the war, many common people without a gun are very to be killed.

"If government is allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? In my opinion,the answer is no.
Firstly ,everyone have their right to decide how many kids they have and no one are supposed to limit it, even if the government. Secondly, The goverment can advise the people that too many person may make the earth worse. However, the decision must be made by themselves. In fact , there are more peoply do not want as many kids as usual. Third, the poorer people want the more kids. Therefore, if everyone have the enough education, the number of children a family want to have will decrease.
In a word, a government should not be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. While the government can increase the education to void so many kids.

By taking the plan that limit the number of children, our country effectively prevents the danger of population explosion. Efficient as the plan is, the human rights are violated. On no account can we ignore the basic human rights. What's more, the plan accelerates the aging process and increases the burden of young people. Last but not least, limiting the number of children will lead to social disharmony. 
It's high time that we should polish the plan and allow the family have many children. I'm think that my opinion is both reasoned and well-grounded.

What's more, if the goverment don't limits, some families think about to have a boy but don't. In the end they maybe cannot earn their lives. Last but not least, in my opinion, government can limits the number but should not be so strict. To have how many children is connect with the basic human rights, isn't it?

As the oid saying goes:"" Every coin has two sides."" Somebody supports it while the other are standing on the oppose side. 
From where I stand, I agree with it. Although everyone has his right to bear child, we all know the danger of population explosion. Once it happened, there will be more and more people who face hunger without any food. Even our country won't step forward but backward. More seriously, one day, our country will disappear as we are too backward to other countries.

"Family planning is the most effective way to solve the population problem, the seriousneof which we often underestimate. Quite obviously family planning has so far macle little progress. At a time when half of the world is suffering from starvation, poor health and a badly Iow standard of living, we simply cannot take lightly the population problem. If we don't control the birth rate right now we'll surely lead a miserable life in the near future.
llliteracy is perhaps the main enemy of family planning.Countries, which share the highest birth rate such as Brazil and India, are also those which share the highest illiteracy rate. People there don't even know what ""birth control"" is.
To me, the ignorance of family planning is a social problem. So we had better begin with social reforms through,say, legislation, etc. Of course, we cannot deny the necessity of the medical approach and we should use it in conjunction with other methods. The answer to the question whether man can survive one of the crises of the 21st century, namely population, is in our hands.
However,at present China's population is still growing very rapidly.It is reported that every year the population of this country increases by an extra 15 million and China is encountering a birth peak during the 1990s.It is abvious that China's economic development and improvement of people's living standards have been and will be greatly affected by the population.Therefore,to control population growth more strictly is clearly essential to the country's reforms and economic development.We should restrethe importance of birth control and call on the whole nation to make more effective actions .

"Nowadays, there are more and more people on the earth. Among them, the number of people in China is the most. Do we have to let go and keep the number increasing? Absolutely impossible!
There are three main reasons why I support family planning. First of all, the land resources are limited. However, the people become more and more. The resources can't feed the people in the future. Besides, It's a burden for a family to have so many children. Maybe the children can't have a good education. Finally, I think people should be excellent not the number we have.

But when the team have over 30 teammates, that will become a trouble for the leader. So as our country, although we have a strong force to resist other countries, we don't promise every chinese people can use their rights properly. In my opinion, it's a good way that we must try our best to protect our rights. As a chinese, we have the duty to take this important task. What's more, if you don't want someone to break your rights, you'd must respect other's rights. Beside, when you find some people use their basic rights improperly,you can finger out that .
In a word, we must use our basic rights through a right way.

"There are more and more people in the world, and in some countries, like Germany and China, having approving the Family planning policy to control the growing population. But is it suitable for a government to limit the number of children in a fimily? For my perspective,  it is a effective way to decrease the population since the increasing number of people has brought many dangers to our society and does no good to our further development .  
To begin with, we all know that the resource is limited. Like food, water, land. so the average portions would be decreased because of the large population. Take the housing price for example, recent years, the housing price has a sharply growth, especialy in Beijing, causing great pressure to young people, obviously, this is the result of the large pupolation. In some poor regions, the lack of living space is not the top problem, because they even have not solve the problem of food since there are too many people to feed, but the food is limited.
Moreover, the population boom also causes great harm to our environment . There are more pollution than before because a large number of people produce rubbish everyday. And the area of forest is decreasing because we need more wood . The number of river and lake are also reduced, because we need water to support our life. Alll these result in many ecological problems, like the extinction of species,  wate rand soil loss, and sand storm, to name but a few.
The growing population also  brought many serious social problems like robbery and traffic jam. It also make the government management become more difficult. 
To sum up , If the government does not do something to control the population, there will be many social dangers  and our human rights can not be fully guaranteed , so I think the government should play a positive role in the population problem.

It might be crowded, disordered and overloaded! Which may called population explosion, when it take place, the country muse be spend a lot money and time to deal with it!

The use of rights must base on the law. If everybody contributes a little, our world will never be out of control.
if the population explosion is get to the maximum, the steady of the society is hard to keep. What's more, the stress in every direction will be more, such as working, studying and gaining money.

And at that time, the population will be a burden.
As a country which has the most population over the world, to solve this problem, the government make the law that there should be only one child that one family can have. It make progress for some years, but with time goes on, we have another problem that our people is going to be old which means that our population is decreasing. So the government relax policy respect, now things are getting better. On the contrary, The Indian has nearly the same population as us but they still encourage their people to give birth to more child. Because their population are decreasing all the time. The same situation also happen in Russia and many country.

"With the development of human society, more and more people believe that people are born with equal rights so they realize that anyone of them has the right to pursue what they deserve to have. That leads to a question. It is reasonable for everyone to get their basic human rights, but does it proper on the point of human development?
In my view, all rights base on proper rules. One can't not get most of his basic human rights if he does not obey basic rules in human society.
Let's see a simple example. What if we abandon the rules that we are using to vote our president in China that only the ones voted have the right to vote for the senior leaders, but carry out a principle that everyone can directly vote for the president they support? I think it is a quite dangerous time for our country's policy. Because it is easier to win if the voter give an enthusiastic but not a wise speech. People's emotion decides the result. I mean, not all people have the ability to tell which voter has the better ability. So it is improper to give everyone the right to vote. And the principle is also suitable in some other sides.
On the other side, if one only considers about his own right but not show respect to other people's. It's impossible for others to take his rights serious,so they attack him. Then he loses his rights.
As what I said above, I think it is more reasonable to limit people's right with proper rules and principles. And the key to keep a balance between the basic human rights and the danger of population explosion is how to a set series of fair and proper rules.

It's also required controlling the number of the people of the country, because too many people will reduce the development of the economy.
Though the government have to solve this issue, they can't use the law to limit the number of children. On the one hand, the public has the freedom to decide how many children they will have, for which to use the law will make them unhappy. On the other hand, the law is used to protect the right and safety of the citizen, instead of to limit the right of the citizen.

On the one hand, the family planning policy is necessary. Due to the huge popularity and limited place of our country, there will be little and little place for people to live, and the pressure of adults will be heavier and heavier, which must influence the development of country's economy and citizen's living standards. What's more, it has been a trend that a family has a child and most people has adopt to this condition. So if relive the limitation now, maybe many family would turn into a mess.
On the other hand, the limitation of control the birth of the second kid of a family should be proper. There's also many families who want one more child because they just want the house to be livelier and they will be more relaxed when they are old. Therefore, having two children is people's personal rights and the government should not disfranchise them.

As far as I'm concerned, the answer is yes. China has a large population which makes a build-up of pressure in many aspects, such as land, food and so on. Because of the limit, the population can grow slowly, which help avoiding the population explosion. What's more, on count of the system, we can get the good living conditions now.

"As we all know, the Chinese Government made and started the policy of family planning many years ago and take it as one of our basic policies. This policy does solve China's population problem successfully, but in recent years, the disadvantage of the policy gradually appear.
The most obvious consequence is the rate of youth become lower and lower. In society terms, this make China gradually losing it's ability to develop economy in future increasing the cost to take care of the elders. And in family terms, the limit of number of children may lead to may make children feel lonely or be spoiled by their parents. This all bad for children's future. And beyond what I mention above, some people with power use their privilege to have more children, which make normal people feel unfair. Having and bringing up children is people's nature and this nature is not different from having data, marriage or divorce. Since people have rights to decide these things by themselves, why they can't decide how many children they have. 
But with the traditional of ""More children, more happiness"", the population problem must be take into consideration. So, in my point of view, the government shouldn't be given the power to limit how many children a family have but they do should take some methods to guide or tell the couples how many children should a family better have in current country's or global condition. If a family follow the government's guide to have children with proper number, the government should give them some award in order to courage other families. In this way people can have the freedom to give birth to baby and the population problem can be solved in some degree as well.

Although it has the right and responsibility to take citzens’ safety of human right and theirs property into consideration，whether to have and how to raise a child are not including in their brochures of responsibility. What they should think about is how to provide more welfare and regulations promising those families which have two or more kids run smoothly which is the same that they edit the layer to support some factories.
It is right for the government to imagine what the future will be, population explosion, pollution, global temperature and so on. There are so much problems, and I believe almost every government in the world are take every effort attempting to solve them, whether for the fame or their citzens. But the most significant problem in this question is that human multiple because their need in psychology and body. We can not take control of a natural process. Once we take some means to depress those requriments, the bad effect will come out of the level of the sea. When the government decide to loose the control of birthing, they discover more than half of the family are not going to raise a child, in which case, a aging society come to us.
Maybe we can learn from a fairy story - how the leader of a tribe called Dayu curb the flooding. Chinese acient wisdom tells us it depending on dredging instead of blocking. My suggestion is that the government should promote the spread of right bearing concept. The government has the right of guiding instead of control. Education is the best way to solve this problem, especially people of the day have higher education level.

If there wasn’t the Birth control policy, China would be full of people now, and not being hungry would be a serious problem. While others, maybe people who loves children, think it in another way, claiming that having children is one of the basic human rights, and the government has no reason to deprive their reasonable right.
  Every coin has two sides, so does the policy. In my opinion, the policy’s merits outweigh its short-comings, and the government should limit the number of new-borns at present in China. First, I think humans should be not only feed, but also educated. If the population is large, there wouldn’t be enough education resources. However, China is face with an extremely negative situation now—the aging population. As a result, the government’s new Two-child Policy remits this situation to some degree, which at the same time cares for human rights.

"It is certainly very understandable that some governments should start looking at ways of limiting their populations to a sustainable figure. In the past, populations were partly regulated by frequent war and widespread disease, but in recent years the effects of those factors have been diminished. The first fifty years of the next millennium will be critical for the world's population. By 2050, population growth should have leveled off, but by then we'll have 10 billion people, which is two thirds as many as we have today. The rate of population growth is something we can choose right now, a matter of human choice. The choice is a complicated one, with many variables, but it remains a choice.
If we want to prevent a population explosion, we should take action now -or assist the poorer countries to do so. They need better government, better institutions, better labor and capital markets, better schools.
Anything that increases the value of women's time and adds to the cost of caring for a child makes a woman less likely to have that child. Since big families are often seen as safety nets for illness and old age, improving poor people's access to insurance, pensions and welfare institutions also has a major impact. This can be as simple as rural credit, providing a means of saving. Finally, there is education--both for women and, perhaps even more important, for the next generation of children.
These steps are there to be taken, but there appear to be some countries that are not seriously trying at the moment. If we cannot achieve that we will certainly not control population.
That said, I don't feel pessimistic that we are going to run out of resources: we are becoming more efficient at producing food faster than the rate at which population is increasing. There is, however, a risk that we will wreck the environment so effectively that the world will no longer be an attractive place to live. That really would be a dismal outcome, to reach world population equilibrium only to find we'd destroyed the natural environment in the process.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?

There are more than 6 billion people on the earth now. About one fifth of the total population is Chinese. And it is known to us that the number of Chinese have limited by the Chinese population policy for several decades. It may be quite different without the population policy that the Chinese government published today. Allowing the government to limit the number of children a family can have which is a matter of primary importance.
The area of the land of China measures 9.6 million square kilometers and some areas of China don’t have the living condition. To Chinese, almost every city is crowded now such as Beijing. It hardly to imagine that if there are more people in those cities. China’s total population is 1.375 billion in 2015. Many problem comes up with large population. Pollution, unemployment, nature recourses, traffic, etc. are the problem that cause by large population and we have to be faced with. 
We can imagine what our country would be like if the population policy didn’t publish by our government. Maybe people can sit on the top of the train like Indian when you travel to another province. More city would be located in the land of China which means the decrease of forests, lake and farmland. When people go shopping they have to spend more time on waiting. And it hard for China to become the largest financial country in the world. The lack of job is not only for college students but also for master students and even doctoral students.
Absolutely, if every parent of each family can think of more about the influence of the population and prefer to devote into the work of construct more attractive country than ride another child, it will never need the government’s limitation.

"Assignment
Should a government be allowed to limlt the number of children a family can have? Yes, I think the government should be allowed.With the improvement of life standard and medical condition,people’s death rate declined and the average life span increased.If we don’t allowed the government to limit the fertility rate,people themselves won’t do that.This must lead to population explosion in our limited earth.
As we all know,population explosion is not a good thing for us.First of all,when the number of people increase,the demand for food will become more and more.However,because of the use of chemical fertilizer,the organic material in soil have been damaged.Land impoverishment and desertization happened.At the same time,a geat deal of plowland have been occupied.It becomes more difficult for us to increase the grain output.So,when population explosion happened,the first basic problem we have to face is food crisis.Then a series of chain reactions will happen.Once one year have a poor crop,famine will come rapidly especially in the development countries.To some degree,though famine won’t happen and people can live from hand to mouth,food shortage can still lead to many malnourished people.This condition may intensified unemployment and poverty.
Except food crisis,population explosion can also result in resource and zoology crisis.The resource in our planet is limited and the environment capacity is limited too.When more and more people live in the earth,the resourse and environment which every owns will become less and less.When conflict of interest happened between people and people,the contraditions between country and country or region and region will exacerbate.Then all the world will be in turmoil.This is horrible.
If the government don’t limit the number of children a family can have,we can imagine that ,one day,people have to live in a building having 2000 floors.At this time sunlight may become a kind of luxuries.People not live in paradise but in a big prision.
As far as I’m concerned,that the government limit the number of children a family can have is to assure the basic human rights better.Therefore,I hold the belief that a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.

"It can’t be denied that the one-child policy adopted by the government have great impacts on our life. Beyond all doubt, policies are originally taken to control the popularity of our country. However, there are more and more people doubt that whether the government has the right to limit the number of children a family can have.
From my perspective, a government should not be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Undoubtedly, to have babies is one of the human rights that couldn’t be deprived by the government. To limit the number of kids a family can have is just the same as to limit the meals in one day individuals can have. Although we know it’s good for our health to have meals regularly, we still feel unpleasant to be required to do as the government said.
Nevertheless, to think of the development of China, the government has to make measures to deal with the problem caused by the larger and larger popularities. It brings lots of problems to the earth. For example, people may find it difficult to find a job. And the nature of the earth can’t provide plentiful resources for our human beings need. So it’s inevitable to take actions to control the expanding popularities, and the root lies in the number of children families have. It’s easy to understand the one-child policy but we just couldn’t accept it.
So it’s obvious a dilemma that a government will be in. But I think that if the government changes their one-child policy to one-child-bonus policy and the policy will be accepted easily. In other words, give those families more bonus to promote the policy but not compulsively limit the number of children.
",7,7,7.5,8,7,5
"   In my opinion, the government should limit the number of children a family can have.
  Firstly, as we all know, China is a super populous country with a population of more than 13 billion. In 2015, the China government change the One Child Policy, every family is allowed to have no more than 2 children. According to the database in 2015, the birth rate of China is 12.07%, the death rate is 7.11%. So the natural population growth rate in 2015 is 4.96%, that means the population increase about 64 million in a year. 64 million could be the total population of a European country. This is only the result of birth control, I can’t image what would happen without the limitation.
  Secondly, birth control can make parents pay more attention to their children. Raising children not just need money, more importantly parents should spend time with them and grow up together with them. What kind of person a child may become mostly depends on what kind of people their parents are. If their parents are lazy to work, with income and low education level, and they were allowed to have as much children as they like, that will be a destructive disaster to our country. So under conditions of the unknown family background, the government limit the number of children a family could have is to make sure every child in our society could become a good person.
  Last but not least, China is a developing country, the government cannot make sure that every child could receive the best education. In western country, children go to high school for free(except the private high school), so children can receive the basic education. But in China, many children in the countryside quit school after the graduation of junior middle school because their family are too poor to afford the fee. It sounds sad but this is common in China. So I think until the whole country is ready, it’s essential for the government to control the birth.

"Nowadays, with the development of the technology, there are a lot of products producted to interest us and excite us. But we feel more void and more boring. Many families have only one child. They have no chance to communicate and share his or her secrets. So, they feel alone. According to this, I think the government should not limit the number of children a family can have. 
In my opinion, how many children a family can have will mainly depend on the thoughts of the family and the government have no power to limit it. In the one hand, stopping the children＇s  birth is a behavior that does not respect the basic human rights. It is against social morality and does not respect the lives at all. On the other hand, if a family only has one child, during the growth of the child, when he or she  feel all alone, she can not find the one to keep company with her every time, which is not good for the children＇s  physical and mental health. More worse, there is a possibility that the children will have the autistic disorder.
   In a word, for the sake of the children＇s  health and growth, the government should not limit the number of children a family should have. It is the freedom for every family.

"Should the government limit the amount of children a family can have
With the society developing rapidly and people’s living standard improving remarkably, what we are faced with is a social phenomenon that more and more people are reluctant to have only one child, which causes a fierce debate about whether the government should limit the number of children a family can have.
As a student studying in modern society, I hold an opinion that the Governments absolutely have the right to limit family size since the government is of the people and for the people. There is no distinction between the people and the government. You may think that now we are in a free country and family size is not the business of the government, so the number of children can be decided by our wish. But, Overpopulation destroys us all and it gives an advantage to the spread of under educated religious nuts of every stripe. It is a universal acknowledgement that the number of people that a country can support is limited. If there is no limit, the result may be the explosion on population and we will run out of resources even ruin the earth. However, on the other hand, if every family only raise one child, the things will go worse either. We should consider not only the population aging problem but also the stress the only child should face when his or her parents get older.
The best choice for the government is to find out the balance of the population. Government can take measures just like a tax after the first two children and a really huge steep increase after the first three and so on . Only everyone in the society obey the rules the government makes can our society get more and more harmonious.

"  Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? What choices we can have toward such questions? 
Back to 1950s in China, the time when this country was newly founded and was struggling almost in every aspect: agriculture, industry, science and technology. The soil and resources are much while the population are little. That’s when Chairman Mao encouraged each family to have as many children as possible. Then in the next two decade came the population explosion. In the late 1980s, the Chinese government began to impose the one-child policy, which technically slowed down the population growth. Up to now, most family here in China still can only have one child. 
Basically every family have their rights to have children, and children’s children, in other word, more than one child since it is human nature that counts. Yet in a certain period, take the 1980s for example, if the Chinese government hadn’t carried out the policies to slow down the population explosion, the pages of history following would have been so different, with too large population and people lacking of food to eat and places to stay. 
However, things are quite different nowadays. China are facing with the aging of population. Family are going to have more kids than they used to in the last 30 years. Consequently Chinese government won’t press too much on the limit any more.
The time has witnessed the changes in China and its great nation. To limit the number of children families can have was meant to be a product of a certain period of history. And as we can see, a government might be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have if the limit isn’t pushed too hard and too much.
",6,5,5.5,5,5,4
"As is known to all，Chinese government released a policy about separate child last year. The separate child refers to a couple, one of which is the only child in the family and can have a second child. This policy stirred a heated discussion in society at that time. What influence this policy will bring remains to be seen, but in my opinion, the intervention measures government takes was right for sake of basic human rights and the danger of population.
One years ago, I have read a novel written by Dan Brown about the anger of population. I used to think that the plot in it was a way of exaggeration. But when I read some report an survey, I realized that it was not exaggeration, it was the truth that happens all the time. Our population has been expanded to a large number, which will cause severe environment problem. Moreover, the more people the earth undertake , the less resources individual will have. Although it seems cruel for couples to have just one child, but it has good influence on the development of  human in the long run. 
The ending of the novel I read before is a person spread a virus to change the gene of 30% of human, which lost the ability to have a child. But we don’t have the virus in reality, so our government has to think out ways to control the population on the earth.
",4.5,6,4,5,4,3
"We have our own choices
    During last twenty years, we can have a conclusion that the earth has too much burden because of human being. Out of the future of our planet, many counties like ours, decides to have a law for Population and Family Planning. So, there comes to us, the one-child.
    We are lonely, selfish, weird and so many cruel words. We are unhealthy both in mental and physical. We don’t know the meaning of share and tolerance. From the other side, there also comes strengths. We have the all attention from the whole family. we grow up with full love.
However, after that, we have 4 elder relatives or more to support. 
Now, let’s just focus on the target for our law. Does it really worked? We abandonded our kids reluctantly, that is not our choice! But when we look at those people who keep giving birth for they didn’t get a boy, they will ignore the law with no hesitation. Consequently, the parents who truly want to have children cannot have, the parents who want to have boy because of prejudice will never follow the law. Is that we want? Absolutely not! The government and law is a tool to control our life, but it cannot overturn the situation. Moral is higher than law. It is a truth that we cannot object to.
We are human, and we have our own choice. I will not deny the fact that the rules will have effect for our life, but if you want to solve the problem once and for all, you have to change people’s mind, thoughts and belief on that.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?

I think it's very important that a goverment should have the power to control the number of children a family can have.

For example,in china,many family in the countryside ,till now, are still very feudal. They thought that they will be discriminated by others if they can't have a boy in their family, so many poor family just keep on giving birth till the ""boy"" is born.

So what's the problem? Let me tell you. As for many poor family, they didn't have the ability to keep so many children. Few month ago, I saw a piece of news said that there was a family which have five daughters but was so poor that the parents coul only buy them some noodles just to satisfy their hunger. And what I can't understand is it's difficult for these two parents to supply themselves life, so why they keep on giving birth?

So, it's very important for government to limit the number of children a family can have.
I think, if the parents are senior intellectuals and have the ability to raise children,then the government should encourage more birth. If not, the government should take measures to control it.
",4,5,5,5,4.5,3
"Last year Chinese government abolished the one child policy, in order to avoid lacking the manpower in the future. But the policy successfully made our country’s birth rate increase slowly. The one child policy had been carrying out for more than 30 years. And it has great influence in Chinese society. For an individual person, it’s absolutely free for him to decide how many kids he will have. Once the number is ruled by the government, the human rights are violated.  
However, taking no measures to control the people’s increasing will also make problems. Especially in large population based country.
At that time, China has already had the largest population in the world, and it would be more serious with no control. Compared with the bad assumption, human rights should be limited. If the population explosion happens, everyone will have less resource and be poorer than before. People’s living quality can’t been promised, neither will they be happy. 
From my own thoughts, it’s necessary for Chinese government to limit human rights and control the number of kids a family can have in 1980s.
Imagining that you have several brothers or sisters, and your family are not very rich. In original condition, you can go to the college to get further study, but now you can only graduate from high school, which means you may fail to find an ideal job or have less possibility to make more money. When people’s fundamental demands can’t be satisfied, society will in danger.
Compared with the terrible condition mentioned above, most people would like to be the only child in their family. But the dream couldn’t come true without the rules.
And people will not care whether their rights are violated.
How lucky we are!

"In a long time ago, China implemented the family planning，which limited the number a family can have. Because the government think that overpopulation can cause some serious consequences, such as environmental pollution, food shortage and so on. But recently the government introduced a policy that one family can give birth to two children. In addition, the number of children for a family's quality of life and the development of the country has also had a certain influence. So now we have to consider whether there is a need to limit the population of China.
 In my opinion, countries should not limit the number of children a family can have. Because the reason that many people want children is changed from before to pass to the cause to today for accompany. And for today's China, population aging situation is more and more serious. It also indicates the Chinese population in the next 20 years will be drastically reduce. And now more and more young people don't want to have children due to stress in your life, it is bad for the country. From the human rights, a family want to have children is our own rights. If state interference on the number of children a family can have, will lead to people's discontent to the government, may also affect everyone's happiness. And if China's population decline, the supply of china will be poor, so countries will keep pace with productivity, which is harmful for China.
As far as I know, now many young people in China are under pressure and don't want to have children. They think they are the children will seriously affect the life of their own, and the child will not be able to bring them happiness, on the contrary will give them some pressure in life. This means that China wants to maintain the balance of the population of China, it is necessary to ensure that there are more children in life more. So it doesn't make any sense to limit the number of children.

"    I think it’s necessary to limit the number of children a family in the developing countries, because the problems caused by the population explosion do much harm to poor people.
    There are many problems caused by large population. Such as the shortage of food, apartment, chance to work and other resources that we have to fight for. Because of the gap of limited resources and large population, the fighting will be even bitter. That make a person’s life be filled with competition and pressure and if one wants to live a better life, he/she have to work very hard. Because in this kind of society, only strong person can still get the chance.
I always have the thought that if there were less people in this country, our life might be slow down and we don’t have to handle the pressure. For our society, there won’t be so many people who can’t get the resources of living. They can live on legal jobs and the crime rate may low down. And compared with a large crowd, the smaller crowd is easier to be managed. For example, if one person throws garbage on the ground, it’s easy to clean up and tell he/she do not. But if the number of who throw garbage on the ground became larger and larger, it’s harder to clean and manage. For the environment, the natural resources won’t be used out and we will live in a better environment.
The problem beyond may also appear in developed countries but the level of harm may be very low. Because the society is ready to support all the people. So in developed countries, people can exercise the right of having children as much as they like. But in developing countries, the first mission is development and the large population will make it harder to make it which means that level of citizens’ life will be harder to rise. So for the happiness of all citizens, it’s necessary to limit the number of children a family. When the country is developed, the situation will be different.

   Especially the old people who lost their children by accident, but they can not have the second child. Who can take care of them? They are always lonely in their old ages.On the other hand, One couple have to take care four old people when they got married, but it always have some problem. For example, if the old people are in different places,how can the couple take care well of all these old people.In addition,the only kid always will be spoiled by the parents, and it is not good for the kid's growth, and the kid has no sister and brother.He will be lonely too.

If the leader don't know what to do, he or she could just simply raise a vote and let the other citizens help him/her out. The second reason is individuality. Individuality is an important issue, without it, the world would be just a big glob of, well, people. The third reason is to follow the trend.

"Assignment 1: Please write an essay about 300 English words based on the following topic.

Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?
Discuss this idea considering basic human rights and the danger of population explosion.



My discussion：
Personally speaking, the government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. When it comes to the topic, we have to put basic human rights and the danger of population explosion into consideration. 
Maslow's hierarchy of needs tell us that there are five big aspects about needs for human: physiology, safety, social contact, self-respecting, self-actualization. And for basic human rights, physiology always is related to body basic health which makes you act as a man and different from other animals in the world and has little relationship with the unlimited reproduction. This means the idea that a government is allowed to limit the number of children a family can have is not against basic human rights. But some religions have their own beliefs and can’t tolerate to be limited to have few children. So when a government makes rules about the number of family children, the national and regional factors should be considered. And then there will be a balance between government’s rules and people’s needs.
With the development of the industrial revolution and science and technology, the population has surged in the past 200 years, and the current population has reached 7 billion. The conflict between agricultural land and urban land is accelerating as the population increases, and the extinction of other species accelerates as well. In order to live on earth, human has destroyed much environment which has been a big threat to human and other species. If there is no limit to the number of family children, the amount of people will surpass the carrying capacity of the earth and all lives will die in the end. At this level, the government must control the birth of the children in order to prevent population explosion.

"Have to limit the number for human right.
Which way do you think your life is? As a person or collective?
In my opinion, both. 
As a person, everyone eager for freedom. All the people are equal to have the right to bring up their babies, no matter what the reasons are. From the view of biology, we need to breed and try our best to evolve our population. Form the view of moral, we should bring up our kids and take after our parents. There are also some other reasons. For example, people have to enlarge their family in order to gain much more labor to make money and support the old in some developing agricultural areas. However, in our modern city, because the welfare system has been established, the old don’t need many sons and daughters to support them. 
So, maybe a government can make different laws for different people according to the specific situations. But it is impossible.
As a collective, it is true that we have to deal with the problem of population explosion. Population explosion bring us lots of big problems, such as traffic congestion, pollution, the shortage of education、medical treatment、natural resource. Once anyone of these problems break out, the victim is the whole society, all of us. For the sake of the society, for the sake of human right, the government have to limit the number of a family.
In a ward, whether the limitation is right or not, it is a decision made by all the people, not only by a government.
  Because human is a kind of intellectual creature, so we will choose to live a sustainable life. TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF A FAMILY.

"In my opinion,the Chinese government should not limit the number of children of a family can have.Here are my tips.
Nowadays ,the thoughts of having children are totally changed and different.In the last past years ,more and more people ,especially young people, payed more and more attention to their work and had less and less passion of having babies.Most of young people want to have a successful job firstly ,and then they will consider when to get married, when to have a baby and how many babies to have .In addition ,if you are a woman ,if you want to have a baby ,it will be hard for you to find a job .Besides ,the pressure of buying a house and a car is getting worse and worse .And raising a child is getting more and more expensive.
All these issues make people have less desire of having children .So even without the rule of only one children ,there would not have more children .As to the rule of encouraging to have two child ,it’s possibly efficient ,but it’s no need .As long as the policy is allowed ,many people ,usually in their 30s or 40s and in urban area ,have the enough enthusiasm to have the1second baby ,because they have the less pessure of rasing this child .But it’s probably not good for controling the population of China .There are not enough recourses for more and more people .And maybe it’s not the best1way to change the tendency that people ‘s age is getting older .
These are all my opinions about this question .
",5.5,4,5,6,5,3.5
"Talking about the problem of limiting of the number of children a family by government,in a big picture,I agree with it absolutely.The reasons why I think so are followed.
Basing on human rights,this behavior should be condemned.Whether we decide to have one more child should be decided by our own will,which couldn’t change by anybody except ourselves.The child is a crystallization of love,symbolizing a beauty and pure love of human relationship,and anybody have the right to create a new life with their partner without any limit,even the government.Besides,a  abandon of human right is out of social morality,which should cast aside without any mercy.Everyone has the right to make a decision on creating a new life symbolizing love.
However, basing on the influence of population explosion,a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.As we all known,the  born explosion will change the social age structure into more percentage of older people who lose the working ability so that they need the government supporting to make a live and new baby,which means there is lower percentage of labour making money for the whole society.Moreover,the increasing of population will heavier the burden of amounts of working positions.When the limited working position couldn’t meet the need of increasing of family with children,more children couldn’t be afford to a education and living level they deserve to support their growth.That might lead to a low level of new generation which couldn’t take the burden of our society to take a new step in human development progress,and it’s possible a negative circling.
To make a long story short,a government should limit the number of children a family can have.The limiting is a violation of human right,though this behavior will make more family and their children to live a life in a higher level and benefit to our society development.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?
  I don’t think a government should limit the number of children a family can have.Person will inevitably encounter some diseases, accidents such as natural calamities and man-made misfortunes. However,if a government limit the number of children a family can have,then a family only have a child.The departure of a young one, is a complete breakdown of a family.And the parents are desperate for life.
  And I think,the right to procreate is the basic right of a person.I don't think the government should use political methods to limit people's right to procreate.A family of three looks happy and stable, but there is always a hidden danger. What kind of family would this family be if the only child suddenly had an accident? What kind of life will parents face?The kind of family,not only brings great pain to the individual, but also brings great impact to the society and the country, whether it is economic or national strength and the future development.
  When the one child policy was carried out 30 years ago, it said that after 30 years the intense increasing population would be slow down, and then a new population policy would be needed. Actually, the population was well-controlled during these 30 years. At the same time, the elderly population surges quickly. Thanks to the Family Planning Policy, it took China only 27 years to complete this process. Our process goes too fast that it caused many problems. So we need flexible policy to deal with the birth of the second child.
  In my opinion,for our country, one-child policy has out of date.And the new policy is needed and necessary.Maybe It can solve the problem of nowadays and the future.

"   Now the population on the earth has become larger and lager and even has changed into a big problem, which everyone has to face and are difficult to deal with.
   In this situation, I think a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family have. Take my hometown as an example. I was born in “only one-child period”. In that period, Chinese government had a firm attitude and took active actions to carry the “one-child policy”. Why did these with so great energy? Consider of the development in the future and better life of Chinese people. Too many people is certain to hinder the development of economy and the whole society just like forecasting.
   Population explosion will become a great disaster the whole people. As we can see in the disaster film, so many people live together on the earth. However, there are only limited resources and living space. Then there are many people ,who is lack of food ,water and other necessities, even to die. And the population explosion maybe lead to conflicts among different nations, countries or religions ,and even lead to destructive wars.
   Of course, the governments should take scientific and appropriate ways to limit the population. For example, the government should take consideration of the human rights. In the process, there are many sensitive problems worth our attention. For the government should respect the customs of different religions and regard human rights as the first key. For people ,the governments maybe provide them with more opportunities to learn more knowledge about population explosion and make them obey and support the policy consciously.
  In conclusion, limiting the population is necessary for the luck of the whole human-beings. The governments should take the appropriate ways to solve these problems and improve our life.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?

Today, many children are the only child in their family because of the goverment’s birth control.Not like their parents,they don’t have brothers or sisters.And when they grow up,they have to work hard to feed a family .But does that policy kill basic human rights? In some degree,it really does.But it also protect the quality of life.
In China ,the government carrys out the only child policy.While in some developed countries,their governments encourge people to give birth to more children.The government’s policy is based on the condition of the country. And what the government does is try to improve national conditions as well as the quality of people’s life. Just list China as an example,China began to carry out family planning in full swing in 1971, bringing China's total fertility rate from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.24 in 1980, close to the world's advanced level.It also allows China to develop rapidly .There is also a negative example-India.India’s government doesn’t control the number of children.limited goods are divided to a large number of people,so each one has just a little.This has led to backwardness and overall poverty in India.It is obvious that without population control, the wanton development of the population will certainly increase the burden on the nation's economy and reduce people's happiness.
So the government doesn’t kill the basic human rights,but gives you more possibility to live more happier. The policy reduces mortality and makes sure everyone has enough resources.Now, the Chinese government has formulated a new population policy according to its national conditions.It is believed that such a policy will lead to further development of China and a better environment for people to live in.

"The family planning policy was put forward by the Chinese government in the last century to curb the excessive growth of China's population. After thirty years of implementation, China's population birth rate has been greatly reduced. But it also brings a lot of new social problems.
The United Nations statistics show that China's aging rate is the fastest in the world. The aging of our population is not only the speed of the fastest, and the trend of ageing population is more than the development speed of national economic and social modernization of our society. The population is in the stage of rapid economic development, the per capita income level is low, the comprehensive national strength is not strong, the premise of the social security system is not sound. This kind of situation is opposite to the developed country's aging, and the developed country's population is aging and the industrialization of chemical industry has been completed, and the economy has reached a high level of development. In addition, China's population aging still has the characteristics of regional imbalance. The degree of aging in various regions in China has increased from west to East, and the gap between the regions is relatively large. In the eastern coastal areas, the proportion of elderly people over the age of 65 has exceeded 8%, with Shanghai reaching 11.46%. The proportion of the elderly population in the western region is below 5%, and some areas are still typical of the younger population structure. The difference in the degree of aging has further exacerbated the imbalance in regional economic development. Therefore, the problem of aging is not just a population problem, but it has also become a problem restricting economic and social development. For these reasons, a change of family planning policy is beneficial to the development of the country.

"Our country is a country of large population. So I think the government should limit the number of children in a family. And family planning is the most effective way to solve the population problem, the seriousness of which we often underestimate. Quite obviously family planning play a great role in the development of our country.
　At a time when half of the world is suffering from starvation, poor health and a badly low standard of living, we simply cannot take lightly the population problem. If we don‘t control the birth rate right now we’ll surely lead a miserable life in the near future. illiteracy is perhaps the main enemy of family planning. Countries, which share the highest birth rate such as Brazil and India, are also those which share the highest illiteracy rate. People there don’t even know what ""birth control"" is. To me, the ignorance of family planning is a social problem. So we had better begin with social reforms through, say, legislation, etc. Of course, we cannot deny the necessity of the medical approach and we should use it in conjunction with other methods.
  But the family planning is not a plan that never changes. With the time goes by, 1 child in a family is not a good idea for a family and our country. The society needs energy to develop. So “two children” is the best idea now. only we control the plan in a good way, can we have a good result at population problem.

"Recently,there is a topic becaming popular among the crowed.Should the government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?Someone insists that the family should have the rights to decide the number of children,while there also are a part of people think that the government should limit the number of children a family can have.As far as I am concerned,the family should have the rights to have more children but at the same time, the government should limit the number.
First of all,I want to mention that I am the only child of my family.So with my experience as the only child of my family,I can say ,there are advantages and disadvantage compared to the family who have more children.For example,I can have my own stuffs and place in my home not like the “children home”.The children have to share with the bed,the toys,the computer etc.Maybe this point will make the child become more selfish than others,which becomes the normal social reality in this ages.Maybe the only child could have their own stuffs,but the children are growing up together,During this time, they learned and play together.Whatever things they want to do ,there will not be alone.It’s obvious that the one child will lose many joy at the age of children.When it comes to the festival,everyone like to stay in the place where is full of people.Think about the one-child-family there are just three person at home.As the only child of my family,I will feel lonely in every Sping Festival.
However,the more children the family have does not mean the more joy the family will gain.let me take the Arican countries for instance.As we all know ,there are less policy to limit the number of children the family can have in African countries,so we can see there are many big family who has many children in African countries.But most of them are not rich enough to raise so many children at the same time.Even some families can not feed their children.In this situation, the number of children bring more stress to the family.Even worse,some families are too poor to afford the fees of raising a child,which makes the child starve to death.
   From the above of all,we can see the advantages and disadvantages clearly.We can tell the number of children should depend on the family.The family should have the rights to decide the number of their children.Anyway ,it also should depend on the environment.The family must decide how many children they can raise to decide how many they want.In addition, the government should play an important part to control the population of the country .Based on this,the government had better take some proper measures to control the population.In the mean while, the families should follow the policy the government made to make decisions.

"Up to now, it is reported that the number of population in China has reached more than 1.4 billion. Regarding to the explosion of population in China, I think government should control the number of children a family can have. 
As far as I am concerned, there are 3 main reasons that can hold my point. One is that though our country is the third largest country in the world, the average, whose whole land is divided by 1.4 billion, is way too little. We should control the number of children to upgrade our life quality and remaining social rights. Our public construction has overloaded for years. Everyone can not get enough what they want. We should reduce population to get our rights. Second is that by limiting the children's number, a family could save more time to look after their only one or two babies instead of figuring out when to take care their second child, when to take care their third child. As for the kids, they can have more time to spend with their parents equally and happily, without jealousy. Last but not least, the trend of aging population is one of the greatest impact to our country, right now, we should focus on that problem. The limitation on kids is not the most urgent one. We can have this debate, but this is not the most suitable time.
Though the limitation on children birth has many weak problems, we can't deny that this policy has made many great efforts to our society, gradually, turning a rude, weak country into a progressive and polite one. There is no such thing can always have good effects, without bad ones. I think the time would prove that this decision for now, is the best decision for our country. I believe ,when the time comes, a family can have more kids than two,which is not the right decision for now.

",7,5,6,6,6,4
"Never should a government has the right to limit the number of children of a family, it’s definitely a violation to basic human rights .Government gets the power from people, and every policy should be good to human rights not offensive. Some reminds us of the danger of population explosion, which can cause the consumption of resources and damage the basement of our society. However, I think it is not a wise idea to limit the number of children by carrying out some rules and bans. Those rules can never solve the problem eventually, and look like to violate basic human right – the right to have children. And this thought ignore the benefit of humans. With more people ,we can create more social wealth and make our world a better place where People can develop naturally and freely. Last century, china’s government carried out a policy called “one child policy’’ ,which means that one family both in city and country can have only one child. If a family want to have a second child , they must get permission and pay for the child’s social costs. In some places, mothers pregnant were forced to miscarry her child. We can read Moyan’s famous novel <<frog>> and learn something about this policy. 10 years passed , the policy have been proved to be successful, the rate of new-born children decreased sharply in China. But it brings one problem :the whole society becomes older, lacking work force to maintain social functioning.And the society agrees that 80s, 90s generation have too much burden. They come to realize the negative result of ‘’one-child policy’’, so the government have to encourage family to have more than two kids. Looking back the history, we know that it’s never a good idea to let the government limit the number of children of a family. But we must know that having too many children is not good for a family , either. it’s better to give a guidance to public in accordance  with reality of the family and country. At last, I think of the famous saying: we hold these truth to be self-evident that all man are created equal, that they are endowed by their creators with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life , liberty and pursuit of happiness.

"It's an obligation to the government to regulate the population for the benefit of a country's development. The substance of 'one child police' and the one encouraging birth are the same, actually. For example, China in the 1980s punished the families that have too many children to limit the population and Russia today levies couples without children high taxes to encourage birth. Huge population will be a heavy burden of resources, energy, education and safety, which slows the stride of social development and triggers unfair social treatment because of the heavy load. Small population usually limit the labor, produce, community and economy, which also slows the stride of social development because of the lack of energy. The aim of these two different polices are both adjusting the population in a appropriate scale. 

Whether regulating the population by forcing people to raise children or not concerning human rights indeed. But the discussion of human rights should be based on the culture background. In the culture of community oriented, it's logical to follow the rational command of society. But in the one which is individual oriented, forcing someone to have children or raise only one child may conflict with his will. People in individual-oriented culture look like more selfish and people in community-oriented culture look like more compliant. Up to now, no government can keep the balance between absolute human rights and national policies successfully because the benefit conflicts always exist in the individual and community inevitably. Whether the policies protect human rights or not only can be judged by native people.

"Not too long ago, the government opened the second child policy, which causing social heated debate. Thus, should government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have has been turned into hot topic by people.
Well, on my own perspective, the answer is “Yes”.
In macroscopic view,our country, with a large population, puts Planned Parenthood into practice, which to a great extent restrained the growth of population.
This policy plays a positive role in reducing the pressure on many aspects by reducing the population growth. Such as resources, traffic, housing and job. Effective mitigation and adaptation in population growth can lead our country take the global challenge better and be a powerful country.
In Microscopically view,the policy also takes an active role.
First of all, lighten the family economical burden, especially in big cities. Therefore, parents can provide more high-quality education and so on.
Second,It is helpful for the development of children. Because parents can take more time and energy to bring up their children. And children will get more love and better resource in nearly all aspects.

"The population in the world is increasing rapidly with the improvement of medical condition. In my opinion, a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have, which actually is an effective policy to avoid the danger of population explosion.
As we all know, lots of problems will be brought with the rise of population. Food, water and even places where people live may be not enough for the whole world. And then there will be many wars about fighting for foods and other resources. Could human race live in such a riot? Besides, it is hard to imagine that after the war how many people would survive and if they still had the power to get over what would happen next and built a place comfortable enough for them to live with happiness.
However, the effective way to controlling the number of people may encroach human rights. In the history, usually, it is the family that decides on how many children they would have. And only a government respect the rights people have can the government has the faith of people to lead the country.
When you face with problems, you should look into it rather than see it in the surface. The influence of population explosion and the encroachment of human rights are the two problems come up from the limit of children number, which are the same questions as the future of human and the basic rights of human.

When it is carried out for some time, many people not only see its advantages but also disadvantages. Thus, people argue that two-child policy should be put into effect. In my opinion, two-child policy should be carried out.
First of all, two-child policy is the gift for some only child. For some families, maybe the parents are only child and they also can have only child. Put aside the loneliness of their child, when their child grows up and they grow older, their child marry with an only child girl accidentally, the burden on their child and his wife is unimaginable heavy. Their child and his wife have to take care of two old couples. Usually, a young couple looking after an old couple is a little difficult; if the pressure increasing twice, how can they stand it. But if their parents have two children, they can share the burden of taking care of their parents. It would be much better.
Secondly, two-child policy can guarantee the number of Chinese population. As the widely spread of one-child policy, some people have changed their conception about giving birth. If they firmly believe one-child policy, there will be more and more the dink. After several decades, our country will famous for lack of population.
In conclusion, one-child policy has out of date. And tow-child policy is needed and necessary. It can solve the problem of nowadays and the future

"Seeing the topic my first reaction was answer is no，of course！Because I just thought the statutory regulation is in violation of human rights to carry on the family line. But, as I read the question more carefully，finding that limit the number of children a family can have doesn't mean we can not have baby but we can‘t give birth indiscriminately I feel so sorry for how perfunctory I was.
       I started to wonder why the government want to set the regulation. The most Intuitional reason is that the population is overflowing in not only China but the whole world. And this is a significant problem needed to be solved. To solve it is too hard but to slow it down from now is necessary. I also find reasons in a deep way. That limit the number of children a family can have is expressing respect to lives，especially to those new lives.
       Follow my line of thinking，when we know the regulation is right there what would we do？We‘ll be more cautious every time we want to have a baby of our own. We’ll start to consider it early or late，right or wrong，this and that just to make sure this baby is priceless for us because chance is precious and the number is limited.

Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?

Many people think that the number of children a family can have is their own business.Actually,fertility is not has nothing to do with country, government, or the whole society, but this matters.On the one hand, children during growing up will certainly add large burden of society and the public finances.On the other hand, the population is the root of the country - it is the ultimate source of tax or other fiscal income, is the guarantee of sustaining social endowment , is also a symbol of national strength.It sounds like government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. But this view is partial. Fertility policies should indeed be incorporated into important national policy decisions, but its content should be depend on the situation.
In the 1870s, heavy demographic pressures prevented the growth of the average household economy, and the single-child policy was fully implemented. Now, the demographic advantage is fading, the population is aging so the two-child policy is being introduced.Fertility policies must evolve with the time.
I know lots of people criticize China’s single-child policy in 1870s,thinking it infringes the basic human rights.But in the China when 1870s,in a world of competition and rivalry,how to make the new China's economy develop,to make China stand in the world is the most important. It is difficult to survive when the country is not strong, let alone human rights.
Anyway,from the current situation of natural resources in the world, population control is very important to study.The danger of population explosion should be avoid,but does it mean that limiting the number of children is the only way?The answer still needs to be explored.

"As we all know, governments serve for people and they should fit the countries' situation to perform the policies. Each country has different culture and in the different place of the social evolution. Governments have the right to make the most important choice to satisfy the countries’ situation.
From a Western humanitarian view: It is wrong and a violation of human rights to limit reproduction. International human rights treaties protect reproductive freedoms and the freedoms to form a family. Limiting the population is contrary to human right and most people will disagree with the policy. It’s unreasonable for government to perform it. In fact, in most developed countries, there is no need to control the population. Because their population is not enough to cause some society matters. In general, the government should not limit family’s population in these developed countries. 
From a practical standpoint: China has 1.4 billion people, and in order to feed them, and provide jobs, the population must be slowed, or else civil unrest would grow and more people would die. The large population has caused many problems to China. For example, it's imbalanced between male and female population. In addition, it intensified an aging population. So people's quality will decrease. From another hand, the source is limited, the population must be limited. Otherwise, it's dangerous to the whole society. A lot of the developing country is growing at an astonishing rate. Most of these countries can't even produce enough food to feed themselves. In these situation, it is necessary to have a select few educated individuals to make decisions for the masses. Most of the time these individuals become corrupt, but it’s the best option.

We all know that China is a country that using the birth control policy to limit the number of children a family can have. Owing to that ,the western world often critics Chinese government about the lack of human right protection. But as what I clarified in the beginning, it is not a simple and small question but refers to many fields which there are many difference between western developed countries and eastern developing countries.

It is easy to imagine the if we doesn’t limit the population, there will be no enough resources to use for every individual. Many people will die because of starvation and poverty.

"To my point of view, the government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Children, as a new born population and potential labor power, play an important role in the development of a country. Thus, it is necessary that government should make some effort to control the birth ratio of children.
Although it seems that interfering the birth of the children obeys basic human rights for it disturbs the natural rule of giving birth. Without population control, something even worse will appear. If a poor family wanted to have a boy so that they had given birth to many children which caused many children starve to die. Only in this situation, will the limitation of baby born from the government show its worth. And comparing to living right, scarifying the right to have babies freely seems ignorable. The necessity of the government to limit the number of children a family can have can be shown.
It is known to all that China enjoys the largest population of all the countries the world. With the rapid increasing number of new born babies, many serious problems come into being. For instance, huge number of children can cause the lacking of education sources, the pressure of competition among the children can cause suicide and so on. In this aspect, controlling the number of children a family have can help to solve many society problems. Thus, it is the government’s responsibility to take measure to limit the number of children in each family.
To sum up, no matter referring to personal rights or social smoothly running, the limitation of the children in each family is very necessary and should gain supports and understanding from the citizens. Allowing the government to control the population have more advantages than disadvantages and it is the tendency of civilized society, so it should be allowed.

"I believe it is OK for the government to limit the number of children a family can have when the danger of population explosion is considered.
We have learned a lot from school about the drawback of population explosion. If there were too many people in the country, the natural sources like water and food would be in short. For example, last century many Chinese people died due to food shortage and the backward productivity when the government didn’t realize the importance of control population. What’s more, we can learn from many developed countries that the advanced productivity and education can lead to low growth rate of population, and low growth rate of population is helpful to improve life quality of people in the country in turn. We have to admit that One-child Policy really made a significant contribution to the social and economy development. People live a better life, and the quality of population is being raised now.
However, the limitation of the number of a family indeed caused some problems. And One-child Policy is always very easy to stimulate international controversy. From my perspective, the policy do violate our human rights. There is no perfect policy in the world. And Chinese government chose to exchange the human rights of one generation for the development of these years. And in the near future, aging society will come after Demographic Dividend. Despite the history, Chinese government should make a plan to deal with the situation. We need to figure out how to keep our economy increasing with an aging society when China is still a developing country.
It is good to know that the One-child policy has been changed. And it is the right choice because it may change the aging society timely and effectively. Whatever, the result of One-child policy is not bad, and I believe the situation will be better and better as long as the government can take measures decisively and accurately.

  Admitedly, more children may have negative influence to family, a country or the whole world. Frankly speaking,more family members means more expense, especially in lager cities. The faster the speed of the society development is, the more stress the young generation must shoulder. Worse more, if the number of children isn’t be limited, it may provoke population explosion. The natural resources, like lands, water and gas all rare and non-renewable, it’s impossible and beyond its bearing capacity of the globe to support more and more population.
  Though there are lots of disadvantage of more children, the government couldn’t limit the human rights to choose the number of their children. First, a only child always means a lonely child. The loneliness of the family, the busy work of their parents and the fast life speed may cause the mental disease of the young generation. Besides, the aging population is becoming increasingly prominent that can’t be ignored. The foundation of adjusting the population structure is to increase the number of the young generation.
  Last but not least, a second child can also stir up the economic development. The Chinese government is encouraging family to have a second child to stimulate the domestic demand.
  To crown it all, the government should not be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. The moderate increase of the number of the children can have positive influence to the society.

"As it is known to all, in order to control the population, Chinese government is implementing the family planning policy to limit the number of children a family can have, which is also the basic state policy. From my point of view, however, the family planning policy is not adapted to the contemporary society. Therefore, there’s no need for Chinese government to limit the number of children a family can have. The detailed reasons come as follow.
  First of all, the composition of Chinese population has changed a lot. The shortage of young people work force becomes more and more serious. Apart from that, our country has entered a aging society since 2000, which can be proved from the result of the population census. What’s more, as it is predicted by the experts, only if very woman gives birth to over 2.3 children that the society and economy can steadily develop. The birth rate of Chinese women has already been lower than that needed rate for normal population replacement. Last but not least, nowadays most young people are the only child in their family. As a result, newly-married couple is in face of great life pressure from raising 4 elders.
  Generally speaking, although the positive role brought by the family planning policy can not be ignored, the government should not blindly limit the number of children a family can have. Otherwise, it will lead to an severe aging society, sex imbalance as well as a situation of aging before getting rich.

" Actually, it’s a controversially international issue whether a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. And the majority of western countries insist that governments are supposed to abandon this policy if they are implementing, claiming that it disobeys the human rights. For that reason, it shouldn’t be allowed theoretically. However, I consider that it ultimately ought to depend on a country’s basic condition.
   China, a typical example of controlling the quantity of newborn babies, which is at the center of controversy. With a large population base, it’s exactly necessary to carry out this ‘birth control’ policy. After all, the population of China highly possible increase so speedy that the lack of foods and resources if our government haven’t allow to limit the number of children.
   Distinct from China, the western country especially like some European countries are firmly oppose ‘birth control’. They protect and support every family to have their babies no matter how many, even awarding the parents who are willing to born. But all these positive policies are based on the condition of a small number of population. What’s more, a part of Europeans don’t want to have children. They have enough space, resources, money to raise children, compared with country like China, and the most important thing--they need these newborn babies for the country’s development.
   There is another example, India, a large amounts of population, is the same as China. The difference is their government never restrict the number of children a family can have. Though it perfectly reveals the humanitarianism, the most terribly result might be accounted for is that India will be the country with the largest population in the world. Apparently, when that moment is coming, space, food, and water are all become problems.
   So, should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? Yes, I think. Because, I’m living in China.
",5.5,5,5,6,4,3.5
"With the sharp increasing of population, the materials which people needed are increasing as well. Human activities have a deep influence on the environment. We discharge the waste water, release waste gases, cut trees and pollute the soil. More and more disasters occur heavily which attract government attention to solve the problems. The most effective measure they thought is family planning. Also, in my opinion, government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.
By the end of 2010, there is the sixth census just finished. It is said that China has 1.3 billion people. This number means the proportion of population all over the world is 22%. What the most dangerous thing is we own 7% cultivated land. The imbalance between population and cultivated land will lead to the hunger definitely. Therefore, we must control the population and protect land. Not only do good to our country, but it is benefit to the world.
The core purpose of family planning is making the population adapt to the development of productive force. If population’s growth rate exceeds the development of productive force, it will intensify the consequence that I mentioned above; otherwise, it may slow down the speed of economic development because of the deficiency of labor force. Therefore, it is hard to control the population into an adequate section. 
Another aim is enhance the population quality. Government always encourages citizens to give a good birth and good care. Only have we raise the awareness of protect the environment, we can really live a happy life. Hence, we should devote to raise our ideological and moral level, scientific and cultural level and healthy level. And the family planning measure plays the decisive role.
To sum up, I think government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Just for our better life and lovely planet.

"In the 19th century, to control the expanding population, Chinese government put out a policy to limit the number of children a family can have. The population controlling policy was always controversial since it born.
Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? For China, Yes. It is a vital policy for China. If we don’t limit the number of children, it will be a serve problem in the future. Larger population means heavier burden China will hold. The unlimited-expanding population will even destroy the normal function of a country. For the development of a country, the limitation must exist to prevent to population disaster in the future.
Some western countries think the limitation of the number children violate the basic human right of the parents and the baby unborn. It is a small excuse comparing to the large problem of a country. To protect the meaningless basic human right, we will sacrifice the progress of the whole country and the whole nation. The profit of the country must be more important than the person.And when everything become in hand, the government will cancel the policy in the future.
Too many people means larger scales of environment broken. We are facing the depletion of energy resources.And the larger population will worsen it. We should put our sight further and prevent the disaster from now on. So, the population must be control until we can control.
",3.5,5,5,4.5,4,3
"     Birth control is always a controversy topic since it has been put into practice. It is hard to tell right from wrong for all kinds of social problems we are facing. 
     On the one hand, no limits of the number of children a family can have would worsen population explosion. There are already 7 billion of people on Earth. We are running out of water, oil, fresh air and many other basic resources . Earth can't afford the population raising freely. Larger population means more living places needed. Our extent of forests is already reducing rapidly each year. More people bring less forests ,more endangered animals and more energy consumption. If the government don't limit the number of children a family can have, human survival could even be a problem. 
    As for our human society, birth control could relieve the phenomenon of preferring sons to daughters to some extent. By holding this bias, many families won't stop giving birth to children until they get a son. Obviously, they won't love the girls as much as the boy. To some greedy people, children could even be their commodities without birth control.They can have as many kids as they want anyway, why not selling several kids for money? 
   On the other hand, birth control do brings  some harms such as aging of population.  It causes a series of problems like pensions, labor shortage, more pressures on young people and so on. Due to birth control, young people nowadays don't have brothers or sisters or only have one.  More living burden are falling on the young people's shoulders. Young couples need not only raise their kids but also their four parents.
   To conclude, it's definitely necessary for government to limit the number of children birth in a family. But the specific number and other relevant policies also need to be discussed carefully. Government need to find a balance in this issue.

" As far as I am concerned, I advocate that government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Because nowadays with the development of society and medicine, our population become more and more larger all over the world. And if there are too many people in the world, there will be a lot of disasters. For example, too many people will consume too much resource in the earth, which may lead to the extinction of human beings. What’s more, too many people will make it harder for government to take care of its citizens when they are old. In the past few years, China had too many people to greed and government had to limit the number of children a family can have. I think this issue is pretty good and it certainly solve some problems caused by explosion of population.
 Some people may say that this government’s issue does harm to people’s right because they believe that giving birth to a child is a person’s basic right and nobody should make rules to limit the number of children. In terms of this opinion, I would like to say that having a child is surely a person’s basic right, but if all the people in the world use this right limitlessly, then our planet will be full of people and our human beings will face the danger of extinction. So the government should take the responsibility to remove this phenomenon and control the population in order to the better future for our earth and our human beings.
 All in all, I believe that government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have.

"I think a government should limit the number of children a family can have.
With the rapidly increasing number of population,the carrying capacity of environment is becoming worse and worse.The land ,the house ,the work position are all limited,so we can’t assure that everyone will have a house to live in ,have food to eat,have working position to earn money no matter in nowadays or in the future.So if the population is still growing ,it will exceed the carring capacity.The comsuption of resources and energy is also a very serious phenomenon,people need food,need water ,need clothes to wear,they need many things that all coIme from the nature,with time going by and the growing population,the nature can’t afford this finally.So that the case of ensuring the self sufficiency of the country's resources to ensure it meets the needs of the population is very important.
Although it is human’s proper right to decide how many children they want to have , we should also consider about the advantages and disadvantages about having over two children.If a family is very poor,that having a child is most suitable.Because raising up a child need high expense and much energy,if they have a second,a third or more children ,they will not afford it and each child’s life can’t be happy too.So maybe having only one chilid is their best choice ,they can put their enough energy and money all on the child , and the baby is more likely to be a better and successful man in the future .
As we can see , China is a typical country of a large population , so I think the government should limit the number of children a family can have.

"My view on limitation of the number of children
In the recent years, most of families face a realistic problem whether a family should nourish another child. However, the government make some policies to limit the number of children. Thus, a sharp argument occur.In my opinion, I support the part of government.Here are two my views about it.
For one thing, in our mind,it’s our rights to bring out our offspring that is independent from power. Of course,We should be ourselves and make birth decision by ourselves. That seems proper well. However, if right get away from any limits, it’s will be a disaster making by human. Except right of birth, human will over use other rights if there is no limit when we know we can do everything.So it is important to give a policy to astrict rights. For another thing, if we failed to control number of people due to no limitation of it, the earth would afford thousand of requirements to various resource and get worse until people can’t survive in earth one day. The limited resources must march the proper number of people.What’s more, people can’t occupy earth by ourselves.We are supposed to share the earth with all kinds of species. Not only animals but also botany are the host as us of earth. We have no right to expel them for our huge population.In this way, limiting number of children protect the equal right between all species and us human.
In conclusion, compared with different efforts of huge number population,we will discovery that for further development and sustaining the earth’s balance we should agree with government to limit the number of children.

"As the time passing by and the social developing, more and more babies are born but less and less people go die. Therefore, the number of people increases rapidly now in all over the world. The large population start to become a burden on the earth.
   As far as I concerned, we must have a powerful institution to control the tendency and change the situation. For each country, their government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Just serious policy and puissant right can let everybody listen to. Most country is not developed enough, especially human’s view. I guess half of them can’t realize how dangerous crisis we meet at least. At once, we have no time to wait that they will change their own mind, but only change their behavior is adequate. It’s useful and efficient.
   Of course, some guys may say this way will disobey basic human rights or broke people the idea of choice. The number of children a family can have is their personal thing, they should have the number whatever they want.
  On the one hand, I can’t reject the reason, even I accept it exactly. On the other hand, I still have some words to speak at the same time. How many members in your family is not only your family’s work, it’s also other’s work. The source is limited. The earth only can burden limited population. If we beyond the scope and break the natural rules, it just can be worse and worse until to the end. 
   There are a lot of successful practice in history. The truth often in the hands of a few. Dominators will do their best to govern our country.The rest of people don’t need to have the same long range plan, they can’t have though. Just accept and obey a new design. You may can’t understand it right away. Nevertheless, when you discover its benefit, you will exclaim and smile in great surprise.
   In a word, I agree with the government control.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? To be honest, at the time I saw this question,I felt a little shamed for myself.My major is law and I should have thought similar question in my own before.  
Overall, family planning is do the most effective way to solve the large population problem in China. Even though the government limited the number of children, a lot of people still are suffering from starvation and have a low standard of living.If we don't control the birth of each family, the problem of population will worse and worse.There is a severe phenomenon that sharp increasing in population of China, and people tend to get more and more old, but many of us didn't realize it, and still ignore the Family planning, especially rural areas.If we are not take steps to control the population,China can not to become a developed-country for a while. 
But on the other side, everyone has human rights which is the most important thing in the modern society.No matter if we want to give birth to a child and no matter how many children we want, it is our own choices which can't be limited by others.What's more, let me give just take one simple example.If government limit the number of children a family can have, once parents are old, they have only one child who can take care of them.It's a huge burden for both of parents and children.For the only child, he may feel lonely during his childhood because no brother or sister play with him.
In my opinion, family planning is indispensable in China.We can't ignore the huge population.Though human rights is important,I still think we can give up some our own benefit for the better future of our country.

  China is a country with the largest population of the world,which means it have to contribute more  and manage more on population than other countries.In case that people here cant live a normal life that can eat enough,live happily.

  As we all know,recent years western countries are nearly facing a situation that the population is down.So they have carried out a series of policies to encourage the family to have more baby so that in the future the society will not be lack of labors.

  So when they stand at the highest point of the morality,who gives them the privilege?They claimed for many times that the Family planning of China is a kind of defense to human rights.It seems that the way to prevent more babies coming to this world is a cruel decision.So is it correct that you just let them come out even expect more?  How do you know the babies want to come out?
  
   What is human right?Is it just the right to allow a person to exist?After the birth,who can assure the living feeds and education?Who can give enough attention to their growth?Who can keep track of them and not give up each life in dilemma?
  
    At that time China gave limitation to the number of baby in each family because the economic was not that developed even can be said to be ‘poor’.But their last generation,were getting older.The young not only faced with supporting children but to support the old years later.To make people can live more easy at every time,the government chose this way .Though there were some faults the policy takers made,the policy eased the big pressure of the country and fastened its speed of developing.

"Limit the number of child In China
The one-child policy, a part of the family planning policy, was a population planning policy of China. Although designated a ""temporary measure,"" it continues a quarter-century after its establishment. The policy limits couples to one child. Our country devoted to limit the number of child. Its history is a long way. During the period of Mao Zedong's leadership in China, Until the 1960s, the government encouraged families to have as many children as possible because of Mao's belief that population growth empowered the country. However, due to the rapid and powerful fertility in China. China has been the biggest population country, and With a population explosion, a series of other problems will emerge. There will be a lack of land, food supply, water, fuel and so on in our country. The population growth was unsustainable and there was a consensus that a birth limitation policy was necessary. The consequence of the problems will threaten human life.
Therefore, we measure the family planning policy to stop the harm. On the other hand, some realized that it not benefit to the human right. The procreation right is the basic right to the human being. It is also the significant point for people to choose one carrying the family on. At the same time, the next generation also have the obligation to service society and take care of olds. One—child policy whether make this right impossible or not. Though, this doubt existed in many people who can’t be accustomed to the new policy. One-child policy also give more chances to those lower living standard.
To me, we generation just the first ‘one—child’. Enjoy the benefit of policy also feel the disadvantage of it. I’m afraid of parents’ love will be divided, but the hard obligation taking care of both olds and youth falls on me all. Fewer children and young people destroy the balance of this society. China is adapting of this circumstance that end to one-child policy and allow two.

"In my opinion, the government should limit the number of children a family can have. China has the largest number of people in the world. In most of cities, a couple only can one child, and in most of villages, one couple only can have two children. 
Our government has huge pressure to manage so many people, so it will lead to social chaos and a lot of unfair event. Moreover, the parents can provide good education environment to their own child and pay more attention to them. It can train more talent man for the society. The Family Planning Policy is a very good policy, especially in China, because China has turned into overpopulation trend. So, it is a very important and urgent to control the China population, and the Family Planning Policy is the best way.
Too many people make our country very crowded and dirty. We don’t have enough resource to support so much people to live in a good life. We don’t have more places for people to live. China has been the country which has the largest population for a long time. Based on the number of China, launching family planning policy helps to address the crowd of people in many cities especially in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. We should take some measures like limiting the number of children a family have. Only when our population maintains in a reasonable level can our country turn round peacefully.
Last but not the least, the aged trend of population may happen sometime in the future because people may live longer than before. Therefore, family planning policy enables a reasonable control of population ratio.

"  While drawing up policies, governments always make decisions base on specific national conditions. Consequently, governments in countries which have large population always adopt policies to cut down the population. China is a typical country with a large population and adopted the family planning policy. 
  Actually government has no power to decide the number of children a family can have. On the one hand, people are born to pocess their human rights while the government has the duty to protect their rights. Based on the law of reproduction in biological community, it is obvious that the intervention of human administration in specific individual fertility is against the laws of nature. On the other hand, limiting the number of children may cause disasters for the human society. Over the past few decades, China has adopted the family planning policy to limit the large population. As a result, the problem of population explosion has been alleviated while the aging problem has been even worse. It did exert an bad influence and bring in fundamentally huge problems on the long-term development. 
  Although goverment has no coerceive power to limit the number of children, they have to take the responsibilities for the benifits of whole society. As the development of economy, population explosion has been an large problem for most developing countries. There is no doubt that the population explosion is cause of shortage of resourses. To slowing the population expansion, many country adopted policies to cut down population. However, such policies can never be the fundamental methods for it do harm to human rights. It is necessary for goerments to pay attention to improve population quality and change their minds in the deep heart. Only when people have the consciousness to deliever fewer babies and contribute to society, the problems on population will be solved.

"If a country wishes to develop well, the government must to consider fully, considering whether this policy will benefit the sustainable development of the whole society or not. One-child policy, as a special national policy, has been in China for a long time. This unique government behavior deeply affects the country and causes controversy constantly.
Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?
My answer is that Chinese government should carry out the policy to keep the social stability during special period by its power.
  Most of people, who are opposed the limited children, hold the view that government seriously destroys basic human rights and it is unmoral. 
I want to argue with them. They just see the short benefits rather than long term. Obviously, they ignore the danger of population explosion. If every family give birth to children without limited, the number of people will rise to an unimaginable the high. The environment we live couldn’t bear the pressure of such a large population. At the most basic level, people will not have enough food to eat, enough place to live and even not have enough water to drink. When survival can’t be guaranteed, how do we talk about national development? If you think your basic rights are more important than the survival crisis of the whole country, please stop. Every policy of government is deliberate. At the period of productivity is lagging behind, the implementation of the family planning policy has improved the quality of life for most people in the whole society. 
This is the same reason that government releases the limit of birth now. For now, the economy and goods and many things are enough to support the policy. Our country also needs fresh popularity to support national construction.
An unwise idea couldn’t lead the whole state to a long range development path. National policies should not be determined by outside influence. Sometimes, you should have overall awareness.
",6,6,6,5,6,4
"First of all, I should tell for certain, the government has a duty to limit the number of children a family can have. 
In other words, the government should carry out the population policy which including not only birth control, but also some supporting policies. Otherwise, we can see that there are some bad results of the one-child policy implemented to reduce the impact on humanity's over-consumption of resources in 1979, such as the falling birthrate, workforce shortages and aged tendency of population. So the time has come for the first big step: a switch to a two-child policy. 
I have to say a range of social problems have been resolved under government control, not only over-population, congestion, and pollution. There is no doubt that population policy have two sides.
But from the human rights point of view, no matter who has no right to disempower others to be parents. However, income, education and occupation are factors that affect people's idea of birth. Chinese traditional opinions of procreation affects society deeply. Decayed ones, for example, the attitude towards 'Bring up their children for old age' will bring heavy burden to the family and the society. The coercive powers of government will be working now. 
However, in the decision-making part, if a government will be able to work from a practical standpoint, if a government can have an insight into the society, if a government’s policy will promote social progress, these bothers me a little bit. A scientific decision should be tested over time.

"The one child policy has been carried out for over30 years, which was put forward to solve the intense increasing population. These days a new population policy was released to adapt the latest population situation. 
Actually, the population was well-controlled during these 30 years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the total fertility rate in China has been slow down, which means we are facing serious baby bust. At the same time, the elderly population surges quickly. Our process goes too fast that it caused many problems. So we need flexible policy to deal with the birth of the second child.  
Now parents of the first generation of the only-children are stepping into old age. China is entering a “4-2-1 Family” era, four seniors, one couple, and one child, a perfect ""Inverted Pyramid"" model. In this bizarre “4-2-1” pattern, with parents above, and the only child below, the young generation is trapped in the middle layer, known as “the generation of sandwich”. Besides, once the seniors had an accident, the child may not be able to take care of them in time. And if the child had an accident such as Hurricane , it would be a total loss for the whole family and no one could take care of the family instead. 
In the new policy in many provinces, the couples who are both the only-child could have two children. It was a necessary amendment to reduce the heavy burdens of the family.  
One child policy was not suitable for all situations, for some special group of people, we need different flexible policy. As the new policy in Anhui and Jilin, for the couples who are both agricultural residents and their first child is a girl, they are permitted to have a second child. It can solve the problem of lacking in workforce in rural family. With poor economy and low development, they depend more on the number of labor in a family.

"From my perspective, government shouldn’t be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. First of all, deciding to have how many children is basic human right, it’s ridiculous to ask people not to have a child. So government can’t force people not to have more than one child or something like that.
   Some people maybe worry about population explosion. In my opinion, of course, population explosion will definitely have bad influence on environment and cause lack of resources. But you can’t say not limiting the number of children a family can have will cause population explosion. Considering the huge amount of population of China and its rapid increasing speed, our government made a law about one-child limit in 90s, which was a wise decision at that time in some way. 
   However, it’s different today. Our country development is rapid, and we have already encountered aging problem mainly due to the one-child policy. Even if one-child policy doesn’t exist now, the government doesn’t need to worry about the population explosion. Because as far as I know, the notion about having children has changed. Nowadays, having many children is old school. People care much more about the quality of life, so couple will take their ability of adapting a child into consideration seriously before they decide to have a baby.

"In my opinion, I think different regional governments should adopt different policies. China, for example, has a huge population of 1.3 billion. If the government does not control the number of children, every family will also increase in the number of Chinese population, this will bring a lot of problems, such as traffic jam, housing problems and shortage of resources and many other problems. Is the most important is the children's education problem, China is currently facing a shortage of education resources and distribution of the situation, if we do not limit the population, so their children to school will become a big problem, the resulting low population quality, social and moral issues. Only if the Chinese government controls the number of children per family and keeps the Chinese population stable can we reduce these problems and promote China's development. A government decision should take into account the needs of its own country, so the Chinese government should limit the number of children a family has. In Russia, however, Russia is sparsely populated, leaving the workforce in short supply. It takes a lot of human resources to build the country and promote the development of the country. So the government should encourage fertility, not limit the number of children per family. Therefore, the government should learn to adjust whether to restrict the number of children per family based on the specific circumstances of their country. Only by the practical situation can the policy be beneficial to the development of the country. So the government needs to think carefully before making a decision, whether it should control the number of children per family, so that it can promote the development of the country.",4.5,5,4.5,5,5,3.5
"   Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? Take China as an example, our government  introduced two-children policy resent years for the sake of enlarging the population. Actually, China implemented one-child policy in the early years, since at that time, China has the largest population in the world  while the economy was too depressed to support those people to survive. The government had no way rather than limiting the number of children that a family can have to solve this problem. Up to now, the economy of China is growing at a high speed that it has never had. Therefore, our country has already have the ability to feed this nation, besides, it needs more people with talents and abilities to help it develop more steadily and fast. That’s the reason why the two-children policy came into being.
   If the government don’t limit the number of children, some poor countries like early China, may suffer from population explosion, however hard they may try to develop, their economy can be depressed forever. What’s worse, the conflicts between people will also increase. And if the government implements policies to interpose, it can be seen as an action of disrespecting the human rights, like the western countries used to comment China’s one-children policy. But the success we’ve achieved proved this policy right. As we can see, China has changed the policy to enlarge the population, limiting the population is just an expedient, it doesn’t mean that China disrespect human rights.
   Whether the government need to limit the number of children depends on the situation that one country be in now. The most important point is that the government is ought to keep the balance between respect the human rights and control the population.

"A GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN A FAMILY CAN HAVE
China has been a great country with the largest population around the world. The number of residents on the earth has been more than 60 billion. The earth has been faced with severe danger of population explosion. So as to solve the population problem, our government had decided to implemented one-child policy. However, when it was carried out for many years, various problems and shortcomings has been exposed to people’s sight. Thus, the policy of the second-child emerged as the times require. Whether a government should be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have or not？In my view, the answer is not.
Apparently, it’s a basic human right that one couple can decide whether to born children and how many children they will have. The only-child may grow up alone without any other sibling accompany. It may shaper an indifferent and selfish figure. It’s not good to a harmonious society construction. And also there will be more and more dink, and then our country will lack of labor forces. However, the second-child policy may force the career women return to family. The anxiety of women career crisis has appeared nowadays, which shows that it is more difficult for women to get a job compared with men. Because employers consider that the pregnancy will take much time. Therefore, it’s salient the feminist will have such worry when they will spend double time in giving birth of two kids. Besides, the second-child policy is a kind of contempt on equality, since the policy may treat women as reproduction machine.
In my perspective, the government should not limit the number of children a family can have. It’s more important to make people aware of the danger of population explosion rather than enact any insignificance policy.

"I think the government has the right to introduce the national and social longterm development of population policy, family planning is just one example .As everyone knows, the world's population problem is very serious.   
Government promulgated the correctness of the family planning policy obviously in China.            
Overpopulation brings a series of social problems, such as the injustice of education, healthy and employmental difficulties ,crime and so on.Poverty in some countries and regions like Africa., the population growth rate is far higher than the rate of economic growth. People living there suffering from disease and war problems. They have no money, no food, and even may lose their lives. The government can not remedy all national. 
Ahough each life is equal, we have no right to deprive any person came to this world right. However, the large population will only lower the quality of life of each person.
In addition to subsistence， the right to development is also very important. Too many people can easily lead to the right to development cannot be guaranteed. In developed countries, people are knowledgeable and friendly. Rich countries are not the most populous. On the contrary, people are not willing to procreate.
    over the past thirty years, the population of Chin a is under control. The quality of our life has been a huge improvement.
   Every family’s pressure decreases. Our resources are protected. Our environment is becoming better and better. Therefore, I think, when necessary, the government has the right to limit fertility. Only in this way our life will be better.

"  Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? I don’t have an exact answer for this question, either “yes” or “no” is not a simple affair. Maybe it depends on a country’s actual condition, including related policies and resources. Based on human rights, if a mother has been pregnant for a second time, she should give her baby right to see this world even if the country she lived is a poor and muddled place. And then the related policies in this country are crucial. If the policy won’t allow a second child to appear, the family should do some preventive measure to obey related laws. Based on the danger of population explosion, it depends on countries’ resources. In fact, it is not every country facing the danger of population explosion, but too many countries’ danger cause our world’s danger. But if resources in this country were enough, mothers can have one more kid. Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? This question covers emotion and law. And I can’t give an exact question.",5,6,4.5,5.5,5,3.5
"                         The One Child Policy in China
This passage is to talk about the One Child Policy in China. The Chinese government made this policy and apply it in the 1970th, which caused lots of sad stories and directly leads to the arrival of aging society. And it is regarded as a huge mistake by some people nowadays.
Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? Of course not. The power of the government is given by people. And every single family has the right to have children as long as they can afford it and the government doesn’t have the right to make it illegal. Limiting the number of children a family can have is against the nature of human.
Considering the danger of population explosion that could threaten the stabilization of the society at that time, it’s, to some degree, reasonable to carry out that policy. But the government failed to foresee the coming of aging society, because they ignored the laws of population growth and didn’t realize that the decrease of birth rating is not reversible. Now they have to be faced with the much more tough situation——lack of labor force. 
What’s more, the population explosion could have been dealt with in a more gentle way. As the quality of life gets better and better with the domestic economic growth, it takes more and more to raise a child. The high cost of raising children will be taken into consideration when a family is thinking about having children, and they will limit the number of children they have by themselves, from personal perspective.
Therefore, the government shouldn’t be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have and they actually don’t need to.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have? In the eyes of people from Western countries, this question seems ridiculous. However, it’s a serious issue.
As we know, China has a huge number of population. To prevent population explosion and its possible danger, Chinese government put the family planning program and the “one child policy” into action in the 1980s. It did arise arguments. Some firmly believed that the policy was inhuman, and it destroyed the basic rights of people, while others thought that the policy could not just prevent population explosion but also guarantee the quality and health of the born babies. Till now, there are still different arguments about it.
As time goes by, the policy do take effect. But the facts didn’t prove it right. The program influence too many people, and experts believe that now China is facing aging society. So the governments then put “two children policy” to make sure that the country is still active. Another debates come, and it’s not just the problem of human rights, but the issue of all different fields. It can’t be discussed on the paper but in action. 
In a word, time will show us whether the policy is right. We are looking forward to it.

"Rights are not privileges
  As one of the basic policies of our country, the family planning has played an irreplaceable role since 2002. But these years, its requirements had been loosen, for one couple can have two children. It doesn’t mean the number of children in a family is totally unrestricted. On the contrary, it can be more effective in controlling the size and raising the general quality of the population, because some children grow up with brothers or sisters’ company.
  Therefore, I think the government should still be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have. Only in this way can a country runs steadily and prosperously.
  In consideration of basic human rights, a family can decide the number of children they want to have. If some parents want more love and care when they get older, and they have enough money and time to bring the kids up, they may give birth to several children. To some extent, if the family have the confidence, condition and ability to provide a favorable growth environment to their children, just like some star families, why don’t they have more children?
  On the other hand, too many people will do harm to our environment. Children will grow up to adults, and grow older to the aged eventually. The number of the aged will increase sharply. At the same time, with the development of economy and technology, more and more people do not like to raise children. Then the number of the young is much less than that of the old. At that day, the problem of aged tendency of population will make it difficult to support the social. What’s more, it becomes harder for young people to find a job, which is bad for the distribution of resources.
  In conclusion, rights are not privileges. Each of us shouldn’t damage the interests of the state just to enjoy ourselves. Thus, the number of children in a family should be limited to assure the normal development of a country.

"Chinese goverment have been implemented the policy of family planning since 1970s. But I dont think it is reasonable to limit the number of children a family can have. 
First of all, it is a fundamental right for a person, even not a citizen, to choose weather to have children and how many children would like to have. Reproduction is one of the basic demand of not only human but all living things. And as intelligent creature, we should have the right to consider how many kids is appropriate and make a decision. The govermemt obliged to lead, but not prohibit.
As for reducing the danger of population explosion, it is also not a good method to limit the number of children. What can this policy do is just control the population temporarily, but from a long-term perspective, it generate a fault. More pressure has been given to young people who have no brothers or sisters, for supporting grandparents, parents and now, maybe two kids. Although the government have two-kid policy now, the economic difficulties are still obstacles to have second kids. It is just a vicious circle. 
In fact, although the family planning policy have been implemented for decades, many families in countryside or rich and powerful still have extra children. It is not executive and not equal, the root is the irrationality. So the government should find more sustainable way to solve the population issue.

"In the past few decades, the government didn’t limit the number of children a family could have. And the result was that the population of human increased a lot which caused serious aging of population. But in my view, I think the government shouldn’t limit the number of children a family can have.
On the one hand, every life deserves respect. We don’t have the rights to kill others even it's a little baby.
On the other hand, many parents love little baby and a new life can give the family new hope: in the poor age, many family choose to have several kids and now the fanatical burden is free, so that they have enough reasons to have several kids.
There must be someone says that the population explosion has a large amount of danger. Such as it could make the earth too hard to support so many people and the live ground couldn’t support so many people to live in at the same time. The social welfare security mechanism may occur lots of bugs.
But from a realistic point of view, with the developing of construction technology, the buildings height can be taller and taller with provides the basic of living. With the genetic engineering, we can grow more food on smaller land. And the economic progress make it possible to establish a sound social security system.
So in a world, the government shouldn’t limit the number of children a family can have.

"Whether the government should limit the number of children one family have
  I don’t think the government should limit the number of children one family have.For one reason the percent of old people is increasing and it’s not a good sign for Chinese future because the teenager and adolescent are the hope of future.For another reason if one family only has one child and after growing up the new family which has two young people and they have to afford the burden of their four parents.
  And if the government allow family to have more than one child,maybe some family will choose to bring up one child but I believe the most family will bring up more than one child.Considering the problems I have listed,eliminate the restrict of the number of children of family have can reduce the percent of old people which means that our country will have more labor force and will appear more talented people and professional people.When one family have more children,the burden of bringing up elder parents will be divided into severl parts on every child instead of pressing the only one child.
  Also the large population is also a important problem,the resource shortage、traffic jam、environmental problem、the starvation and many problems results from overpopulation are a stress oppressing us.But I hold the view that the restrict of the number of borning child of every family is not a good way to solve the problem of population increasing.The basic solution is to change people’s mind about population problem and assisting with policy.This problem can’t easily use the simple way but change it gradually and it needs a long time to relieve and finally solve it.It’s a long time project and we can not change it in a hurry.
",4.5,6,5,5,5.5,4
"Is it right to set a limitation on the number of children a family could have? In China, people were asked not to have more than one child in one family many years ago. Although today the government encourages families to have two children, the limitation is still there. Some criticize that the policy is against human rights and should stop. While in my opinion, there are several reasons that can back up the policy.
First off, when it comes to basic human rights, the limitation doesn’t completely prohibit families to have more children. As long as the parents have enough money as their compensation fee, they can have a third child. The fee serves as a prove of the parents’ ability to afford their children. On the other hand, if the family doesn’t have the money, which means they can’t raise their children well, the limitation prevents them from abandoning children. So the policy is not against basic human rights. It is protecting those poor children who might be abandoned because of poverty.
Secondly, the limitation policy is a solution to population explosion. Population explosion is a national issue for developing countries. The danger of it includes low employment rate, lack of resource, and environmental problems. Apparently if the country wants to avoid the dangers, lowering the birth rate will be fundamental. Otherwise, the explosion of population will do harm to the country’s economy instead of increasing it. The limitation policy has done well on the population crisis.    
Last but not the least, the policy can enrich family happiness. The less children a family has, the more care a child will receive from the parents. The possible cost on children’s education can be saved so that the family can increase their living quality. This is one of the advantages of having one or two children.  
In conclusion, the government should do something harsh to limit the family children number. It is not only because of the effectiveness on the population explosion, but also because it benefits ordinary families.

"As the rapidly development of the technology and society, more and more people can live a longer life. It sounds like a nice thing, but naturally, every coin has two sides, the serious situation it brings is that the rise in population far outstripped the production of food. So that, although so many people can live a longer life, not each person can live a better life.
  According to this problem, government carried out a policy that only both parent is the Only child can have two children, besides, they only can have one child. 
As it was shown in a chart of population analysis, the implementation of the policy is very effective, low birth rate and low  natural growth rate. 
But should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have like that?
In one hand, in terms of the national development, it seems a smart choice. More people means need more land and more resources. In 1980’s we didn’t have enough resources, so the only thing we could do was limit the population.
But on the other hand, in terms of human rights, it seems a bit bloodiness. How many children the family has should be depended on that family, not the other people. it seems so strange that another person forces the family that you only can have one child, so is government. Moreover, if that family really love children or that family need more children to make money, and so on, it all will bring pressures on the only child.
Anyhow, the policy is implemented a long time. In my perspective, although that policy seems a little bloodiness, it was the product of that period, we need to understand.

"Should a government be allowed to limit the number of children a family can have?
 To be honest, nobody has rights to limit the number of the children of a family which has done nothing wrong. However, in order to improve the development of our country, the government has to promulgate this policy. 
So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the children-limit on earth? 
As we all know, the population of China has been an extraordinarily large. Limiting the number of the children of every family is the most effective way to control the fast-growing population. After the reform and opening, the large population obviously became the biggest resistance of China’s prosperity and steady development. Maybe for the poor families then, more children means more labors and more possibility to earn more money. However, the reality is that only the prosperity of our country can lead to everyone’s peace and richness. On the other hand, if the population explosion happens, there will be more and more people have no food to eat to keep alive. Though the measure of our country’s area is big, it can not provide food for so many people. China will run for food every day and have no time to care about the financial development.    And at that time, China will be fat for any other country. Peace and happiness will leave from us. Besides, too many people will also lead to less positions provided for people. There will be more and more people have no job and no ways to earn money.
In a word, though this policy limited the people’s rights, it really help China to be a stronger country and help us to be richer and happier. 
",5,5.5,6,6,5.5,4
"To be honest, I don’t think that the government should be able to limit the number of children a family can have. First of all, more children are the gifts for some only child. For some families, maybe the parents are only child and they also can have only child. when their child grows up and they grow older, their child marries with an only child girl accidentally, the burden on their child and his wife is definitely heavy. What’s more, when they have children, their burden will be heavier. Their child and his wife have to take care of two old couples and a baby. Usually, a young couple looking after an old couple is difficult; if the pressure increasing twice, how can they stand it? however if their parents have two children, they can share the burden of taking care of their parents. It would be much better. And two-child policy can guarantee the number of Chinese population. As the widely spread of one-child policy, some people have changed their conception about giving birth. If they firmly believe one-child policy, there will be more and more the Drinkwater several decades, our country will famous for lack of population.
As a result, our government shouldn’t limit number of children a family can have.
",5,5,4,5,5,3
"Whether give birth to a baby is a basic right of human. But does it mean we should tolerant sharp increasing birth rate despite the heavy resources burden? Negative. 
 If we see this from the aspect of a citizen, it will never be a question how many children I should have at most. In fact I can keep having baby if I want, because I like the feeling of surrounded by children. But why I will never do as what I think under some circumstances such as if I lived in China or India? Because in some country, there is a huge population burden for all resources. Even if there is no such a kind of policy to restrict the number of children a couple can have, I would not be willing to add more pressure to the server environment and society comdition.
So back to the restriction policy, all population control policy is based on the curren situation of a country. If there is an explosion of population, several years later, they will have to face higher living price, harder employment situation and more fierce competition. And the country will have to bear serious result brought by growing population such as electricity shortage, increasing pollution and high natural resources consuming. So if a country needs to develop healthily, it has to control the number of children a family can have.
There used to be a slogan in the beginning of propagating the One Child Policy, it said” If you want to become rich, give birth to less children and plant more trees” For most uneducated habitant, they don`t comprehend the meaning of population control, so it is with their children. The increasing population also brings difficulty to education, which also do harm to the development of country.
So if population is a problem to a country, it has to be put into policy for the further development.

"                My opinion in “family planning policy”
  As we know, Chinese government carried out a policy in last century that every family just allowed have only one baby which to control the rapidly growing of the population and release the pressure of food. Recently, the government changed this policy into every family be allowed to have two babies. But does government have the right to control how many children do a family have? Is it really reasonable?  Different person have different view to see the world. Here is my opinion: I think this policy is reasonable.
  First, in the view of the human right, Some people think that this policy is offense the right of birth. But actually not, in law, the human right can be divided into individual right and integral right. It means human right can not only consider about the profit of yourself. You need ensure your profit doesn’t hurt others right and protect the maximum of integral right.
To give birth to vast babies will threat the supply of food. About this, I will explain in next paragraph. In another word, if you deliver so many babies that you can’t bring up, in some degree, it can be regarded as a kind of hurting the human right of the babies.
  Second. The exploration of population is a disaster in the world. We live in an age that this little blue plant keeps about 70 billion persons to alive. The earth can’t feed more people. If the government doesn’t control the birth rate, it will cause the starving. More and more people lose their job, the price of the food still raise, finally, war break out. How horrible is it! So this policy in this age is very important.
  At the end, with the developing of technology, I believe human can find another solution to solve all these problems. At that time, we can have babies that we want and the society will access a better future.

"Something about China’s One Child Policy

As we all know, One Child Policy is running in China for a very long time. I am one of its products. But how can we understand this policy and should government limit the number of children a family can have?

We need to know baby-born is a basic human right. If you think you have enough sources to raise more than one baby then you can surely do it. But we are civilians at the same time, we must consider what situation our nation is lying. For China, it has more than eight hundred million of people in the last century. Even if China’s government toughly run the One Child Policy, its population still goes to thirteen hundred million. 

For another example, to many north European countries, they don’t limit the children’s number but courage their families to try their best to bring more babies to them. The most significant reason is they are lack of people. They usually just have millions of people in a country and their society is not healthy for country’s development. In other words, their birth rate is very low. They need more new-born babies to make sure they have future. If a country doesn’t have the young any longer but more and more the old, well, then this country can’t exist any longer too.

So we can see we must consider both human rights and nation’s situation to decide whether government should limit the children’s number in a family.
